                        On April 29, 2024, the University of Chicago joined X
                        other universities across the nation in establishing an
                        encampment to support divestment from Israel. Students
                        argued that doing so was imperative to stopping the war
                        on Gaza and saving Palestinian civilian livesCITE
                        (QUOTE?). Paul Alivisatos, the University president,
                        sent the following email to the student body:
                    </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            I believe the protesters should also consider that
                            an encampment, with all the etymological connections
                            of the word to military origins, is a way of using
                            force of a kind rather than reason to persuade
                            others. For a short period of time, however, the
                            impact of a modest encampment does not differ so
                            much from a conventional rally or march.

                        Was Alivisatos justified in assuming that student

                    Fossil fuels As a student of the undergraduate class of '22,
                    I had been relatively new to the idea of divestment. Like
                    Alivisatos, I had assumed that campus movements had
                    originated in the BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanction) strategy
                    central to pro-Palestine activism. But the refrains commonly
                    heard across the Quad have their roots in the 1970s.

                        During my final weeks of research in the Maroon
                        archives, I opened the 1980s files, hoping to complete
                        the dataset with the earliest articles. The first
                        sentence I read was this: "The protest against U.S.
                        involvement in South Africa has a long history".
                        February 27, 1979. Those words were, by now, 57 years
                        old.

                        Curtis Black, the article's author, was referring to the
                        protests outside the Continental Illinois Bank in 1967,
                        years before the word "divest" was used to describe such
                        movements. Students protesting the bank's holdings in
                        South Africa were summarily arrested. Little else was
                        heard on the topic until ten years later, when momentum
                        on South Africa gathered at campuses across the country.

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>
                    This project focused on pro-divestment activism and the
                    administration's response. Student- or faculty-led
                    counter-activism events were not included due to project
                    scope. A pro-divestment activism event was defined as
                    follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        All articles from the Maroon website or digitized
                        archives which:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contained the word "divest" from search results</li>
                        <li>
                            Had divestment as the main subject, excluding
                            personality-based attacks (some letters to the
                            editor were not focused on arguing divestment as a
                            moral or political issue)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Could be defined as a discrete event (i.e., not a
                            general explainer or background for divestment
                            movements)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Were located on UChicago campus or involved UChicago
                            students (as opposed to reporting about other
                            schools or Chicago city politics)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
