                                six on April 30th, you’d stumble upon what was
                                perhaps the most eclectic pre-game in history.
                                The pre-concert hour of Ensemble Dal Niente’s
                                Party 2016 kicked off with live performances of
                                works by Erik Satie and Esa-Pekka Salonen (with
                                an arrangement of Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky”)

                                Niente, after the 1970 piece by German composer
                                Helmut Lachenmann. The name was a nod to the
                                repertoire the group sought to defend, and
                                <i>dal niente</i>—Italian for “from nothing”—was
                                also an apt description of the group’s genesis,
                                springing from a void they sought to fill. The

                                music collective,” with “collective” being the

                                come at you.”

                                the party this year, for sure,” Cafarelli said.
                                “It’s good to have that match: Dal Niente is
                                like the serious uncle, and Parlour Tapes+ is
                                the fun cousin.”

                                response to the question, “Why do you want to be
                                a composer?”, one contestant answered, to much
                                laughter, “’Cause I want to be rich and famous.”

                                As promised, the audience—which included
                                everyone from retirees to UChicago faculty to
                                slouchy college students—decided what they
                                wanted to get out of Party 2016. The venue’s
                                shoebox-shaped layout was arranged so that those
                                farther from the stage could continue
                                socializing quietly or move to a separate room
                                on the lower floor, while those who wanted to
                                listen to the music uninhibited were encouraged
                                to move closer to the stage.

                                For certain pieces, the definition of said
                                “stage” was blurred, to great effect. I plopped
                                down on the air mattress for James Tenney’s
                                “Critical Band,” which stationed musicians in
                                different positions around the room. The piece
                                begins on a unison concert A, diverging by
                                fractions of a tone and passing through grating
                                dissonances before returning to an overtone-rich
                                reiteration of the original pitch. The effect
                                was hypnotic and acoustically sublime.

                                The evening’s repertoire also challenged the
                                definition of “music,” at least in the absolute
                                sense. Parlor Tapes+’s world-premiere
                                contribution “Inside-Outside Rave Pyramid”
                                resembled an avant-garde theater piece more than
                                anything, “scored” for four amplified
                                performers. Other works, like Natacha Diels’
                                “Elpis” and Jessie Marino’s “Witford Rimley and
                                his Robotic Dog Seize Burger King in a Bloodless
                                Coup” (worth mentioning by merit of its name
                                alone) were similarly performative.

                                Prins’ “Generation Kill” (2012) was easily the
                                most ambitious undertaking of the evening, and
                                perhaps the most representative of Dal Niente’s
                                try-anything ethos. The piece calls for eight
                                musicians, four playing instruments and four
                                operating PlayStation controllers. The “gamers”
                                manipulate pre-recorded audiovisuals of the
                                musicians as the actual musicians perform behind

                                a hairbrush, the guitarist whirring a milk

                                The piece was met with an enthusiastic ovation
                                by all those who remained. While trying to
                                beeline offstage, Lewanski was stopped short by
                                a cry: <i>“Speech!”</i>

                                “Thanks!” was all he chirped. Then he zipped

                                Lewanski’s promise rang true: where the concert
                                hall prescribes escapism as entertainment, Party
                                2016 held up a mirror to our media-saturated
                                lives, without cushioning nor pretense. It was
                                eclectic, it was accessible, it was honest—and
                                yes, sometimes it was a little chaotic. In
                                short, it was the kind of birthday bash only Dal
                                Niente could pull off.
