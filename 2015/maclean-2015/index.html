                        In the past couple weeks, you’ve probably read and heard
                        a lot about the recent housing decision. Some students
                        finally feel liberated from the distant, isolated dregs
                        of an outdated UChicago regime; others seem to be arming
                        themselves for a coming apocalypse. But a great many
                        students take the optimistic middle road: It’s about the
                        community, not the building or the names. In the case of
                        Maclean, however, UChicago’s northernmost and
                        westernmost dorm of only one house, the community is
                        characterized by and centered on the physical building.
                        It’s embedded in its very walls.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Maclean House celebrates a tradition unique among all
                        other dorms. As a member of this small community, I have
                        had the rare chance to live in the midst of it. Simply
                        take the short walk a block past Ratner, step inside,
                        and you’ll notice it from the get-go. The walls of
                        Maclean are covered in quotes. Every floor, from
                        stairwells to ceiling braces to elevator doors: quotes,
                        quotes, and more quotes. They range from the inspiring
                        and familiar to the silly and obscure, yet each is
                        expertly executed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        “I think that it’s a great conversation piece for those
                        who come here that have never been here before,” Maclean
                        House Resident Head Ali Jackson said. “I love watching
                        their initial reaction where they go around and see the
                        various quotes that we have on the walls because they’re
                        just completely fascinated. And you could literally
                        spend all day studying each quote.... It seems like
                        every day I read something new on the wall that I had
                        never taken the time to read before.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Most of the quotes throughout Maclean are written in
                        English while others are in Arabic, Spanish, Latin, and
                        Chinese. Some highlight imagery more than phrase, but
                        almost all are physically painted onto the wall, with
                        the exception of the digital message board plugged into
                        the doorframe of the second-floor solarium. Far beyond
                        simple lettering, these quotes are works of art, and
                        Maclean’s first floor is proof.

                        The south wall of Maclean’s first-floor living room
                        (“HQ”) brandishes an intricately carved world map,
                        realized in sheer black paint. The elegant calligraphy
                        centered above the painting quotes Tolkien: “Not all
                        those who wander are lost.” Resting in the background of
                        the heart of house life, this quote harkens back to a
                        commonly beloved fantastical journey and acts, as most
                        quotes do, as subtle reassurance to the young college
                        everyman. The nearby dining room also exhibits
                        large-scale works: two pictorial comic strips featuring,
                        on the left, God’s sacred gift of bacon and, on the
                        right, a play on the theory of statistical correlation—a

                        Certain artworks verge on full-on murals, from the
                        massive rays of sunlight shining down on the encouraging
                        sentiments of Yolanda Adams to the grand lettering of
                        Douglas Adams’s humorous “UNIVERSE.” An erratic
                        profusion of color and splintered lettering across an
                        entire section of second-floor hallway lends playful
                        distortion to the lyrical words of Lewis Carroll. At the
                        same time, Maclean’s smaller illustrations demonstrate
                        diligent attention to detail, such as the depictions of
                        quotes of Nick Gatsby and Dwight Schrute. The great Dean
                        Boyer himself even makes an appearance on the walls of
                        Maclean: “The only way to beat a party is to throw a
                        bigger party.”

                        A well-loved house favorite is the parody painted on the
                        central ground-floor stairwell. As a Macleaner, it
                        starts your day and welcomes you home, reminding you to
                        “Play like a nerd today.” Notre Dame fans will recognize
                        this spin-off immediately, and Macleaners embrace its
                        all-too-typical UChicago humor. This tradition, however,
                        is not about glorifying flashy, recognizable phrases.

                        “A lot of these quotes are anonymous,” second-year Cairo
                        Lewis said. “You don't even know where they came from,
                        so it’s really interesting to go and have to research
                        where exactly the quotes came from, what influenced the
                        person to put that on the wall. I think there’s a bigger
                        story behind the quotes.”

                        This story starts with Maclean House orientation aides
                        and orientation leaders, who arrive on campus early each
                        fall to prepare for incoming first-years and, more
                        importantly, to immortalize their chosen words on the
                        walls of Maclean. The process itself is quite complex.

                        First, students spend months agonizing over the choice:
                        the single quote they will forever embed on the walls of
                        their home for future generations to behold. The one
                        quote that emerges victorious from this inner struggle
                        must then be transformed into artistic reality. Most
                        students design their quote in Microsoft Word to test
                        out font, style, and layout. This design is then
                        printed, projected onto the wall, traced, and painted
                        not once, but three times over. Despite the massive
                        scale of some designs, each one demonstrates a keen
                        attention to detail. Edges are clean. Fonts are
                        consistent. Colors are vibrant. These are not silly wall
                        doodles; these are artistic feats.

                        Of course, some more adventurous students still opt for
                        the free-hand approach, such as third-year and Maclean
                        House R.A. Madeline Klinger. “It’s kind of like getting
                        a tattoo,” Klinger said, “not on your body but on your
                        home, which is still very much a part of you.” Klinger
                        purposefully positioned her E.E. Cummings quote directly
                        across from her room so that it greets her every time
                        she steps out her door. She expressed deep emotional
                        attachment to both the quote and her own material
                        interpretation of it—a design in which she literally
                        left her thumbprints behind.

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Mohamed Hammoud, a third-year in Maclean and one of this
                        year’s orientation aides, explained the rationale behind
                        his quote selection: “I am personally Moroccan, and I am
                        very proud of my culture…. I wanted to add yet another
                        language to the list of languages.” Like Klinger,
                        Hammoud chose to paint his quote across from his room.
                        He even incorporated the red and green colors of the
                        Moroccan flag into the Moroccan Arabic script of his
                        proverb, which encourages any passerby to live life
                        without regrets.

                        This living record of Maclean history allows students
                        and alumni alike to engage in a continual dialogue—a
                        mutable mélange of culture, experience, and intellectual
                        thought. One can witness this very process take place on
                        the walls, for certain adjacent quotes directly
                        reference and sometimes contradict one another. Klinger
                        discussed one of her experiences conversing with the
                        past: “There’s a Camus quote over there. Cummings and
                        Camus are both my two favorite dudes. It’s just kind of
                        cool to see that someone else had read that quote and
                        felt a similar way to the way that I connected to
                        Camus…. They’ve graduated, they’ve moved on, they're
                        doing things with their lives, and if they got through
                        it, I can get through it. It’s like having all of these
                        invisible ancestors.”

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        The irretrievable artistic legacy of the quotes and
                        students’ genuine attachment to the physical structure
                        of Maclean have made the recent housing decision all the
                        more difficult for some Macleaners. Hammoud reflected,
                        “I won't be able to come with my kids and be like, ‘See
                        that building over there? That’s where I used to live
                        when I went to college here.’”

                        Klinger, who used to live in Max Palevsky Residential
                        Commons, explained her experience living in a larger
                        dorm: “It still felt homey. There was a good community
                        within the house, and the RHs were great. But you, you
                        didn’t <em>draw on the walls</em>. You couldn't see
                        things from years past on the walls all around and
                        wonder what those people were like, and why they chose
                        that quote—what they were going through.”

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Despite the unavoidable demolition of the quotes now
                        adorning the walls of Maclean, there is still hope for
                        the survival of this house tradition and even for the
                        quotes themselves. Lewis, Klinger, and Hammoud all
                        expressed interest in documenting the current quotes and
                        perhaps recreating them in the new Campus North
                        Residence Hall. Yet the heart of the issue still rests
                        with the nature of the building itself.

                        “I’m sure people would get into painting on walls in
                        other dorms,” Klinger said, “but because they’re such
                        big dorms, and they have so many other houses, it
                        wouldn’t have quite the same effect. It would be just
                        kind of like, ‘Oh this is a fun art project,’ rather
                        than like, ‘Yeah, this is my home.’”

                        Nonetheless, Maclean House Resident Heads Ali and James
                        Jackson remain optimistic about carrying over this
                        tradition. “That’s something that my husband and I are
                        definitely going to try to champion and try to have a
                        conversation with housing. Hopefully they allow us to
                        carry this special tradition over because it is so
                        special and it really means a lot to our students,” Ali
                        Jackson said. “I think having the ability to keep
                        something like this going is only going to help that
                        transition be that much smoother and help us carry a
                        part of our culture.”

                        Until that time comes, students will continue to paint
