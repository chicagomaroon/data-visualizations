                        86 degrees. Everyone acts surprised when reading the
                        temperature in that room, but it shouldn’t really be a
                        surprise. Somewhere close to 20 people are crammed
                        inside a living room and kitchen space designed for
                        three. A set of huge light fixtures gives off heat like
                        radiators. Red gels in front of those lights bathe the
                        walls and people in a red monochrome daydream. This
                        stuffy room is a hot spot surrounded by the coldest
                        winter, a red blip amid the endless white waiting
                        outside. It’s almost a different world. Perhaps this is
                        fitting. The film being shot here, entitled “Age of
                        Blossoms", is like a dreamy shadow of reality more than
                        an accurate representation of it. No one can see it
                        during shooting, but the film will make heavy use of
                        slow motion and feature no sound recorded on set.

                        It might be for this last reason that production is
                        moving along so smoothly. The various productions of
                        Fire Escape Films, the RSO behind this and numerous
                        other student projects, have historically had more
                        trouble with the sonic elements of film production than
                        the visual ones. Part of the rationale behind director
                        Grace McLeod’s choice to omit dialogue from the film was
                        to circumvent this technical challenge, calling it her
                        “best decision.”

                        But behind this nonchalance is a meticulous attention to
                        detail that has paced the project throughout its nearly
                        six-hour shoots. On the kitchen counter there is a short
                        stack of papers with neat and detailed diagrams for
                        every shot in the entire film. They remain untouched for
                        much of the shoot, but that only seems to indicate that
                        everyone knows their contents already. The actors
                        require little coaching and each shot needs only a few
                        takes before McLeod is satisfied. “I think it’s a
                        reflection of how much time we put into pre-production
                        that it wasn’t crazy on set,” McLeod said. She chuckles,
                        “At least it wasn’t that crazy.” She has been at this
                        for a long time. Though only a first-year, she took a
                        gap year after graduating from high school to
                        participate in a fellowship at the Tribeca Film
                        Festival. She directed a film as part of this program,
                        following others she had made in high school.

                        This quarter, Fire Escape called on its members to
                        create pastiche projects inspired by the style of famous
                        directors. McLeod wrote and submitted the script for
                        "Age of Blossoms" as a homage to Hong Kong–based
                        director Wong Kar Wai, specifically 2000’s In the
                        <em>Mood for Love</em> ("Age of Blossoms" is itself a
                        translation of the original film’s Cantonese title).
                        Soon enough, McLeod found herself sitting in the
                        director’s chair. Her film is one of five pastiche films
                        and one of the eight overall films produced through Fire
                        Escape this quarter. In recent years Fire Escape has
                        been increasing its resources and membership, giving
                        students opportunities to work on films in many
                        different roles — often with relative newcomers
                        alongside hardened veterans.

                        McLeod borrows several visual elements from Wong’s film
                        in areas ranging from the rich colors to the film’s slow
                        frame rate. The film itself crosscuts between two
                        parties: one a typical if decidedly red-hued college
                        apartment party, the other a children’s birthday party.
                        This juxtaposition requires the crew to transform the
                        room into yet another strange space. Off came the red
                        coverings, into boxes go the prop bottles of liquor, and
                        out came the cone hats and birthday cake. Soon, fistfuls
                        of candy were being thrown around the room. These were
                        among the more technically challenging shots to
                        complete, along with several of a beer pong game where
                        the balls proved uncooperative. As a crew member
                        retrieved a bouncing one with some difficulty, director
                        of photography Keegan Morris grinned and said, “It’s
                        child actors, animals, ping pong balls. Those are the
                        hardest things to deal with.”

                        Like McLeod, producer Sofia Butnaru, and much of the
                        cast and crew, Morris is a first-year but still looks
                        confident on set. In high school, he would regularly
                        work on student video projects and even occasionally
                        made videos instead of papers for class projects. In
                        some sense he is a triggerman, framing and filming shots
                        that have been pre-planned, but in between takes he was
                        constantly in dialogue with McLeod over possible
                        revisions, both technical and creative. He was the first
                        to see a stray shadow that would interfere with a shot.
                        He was often the first to propose a correction. One shot
                        features a close-up of actor Eric Kirkes, but his face
                        was not well lit and space was too tight for a proper
                        light fixture. Morris suggested the shot be changed so
                        that Kirkes looks down at his phone, the light of which
                        will illuminate his face. They try it, and McLeod later
                        calls it her favorite shot of the film.

                        pink cupcake piñata that I wanted to be this crown jewel

                        But once all the footage was taken and the equipment
                        packed up, there was only so much that could be done
                        about a shot gone wrong. Among the casualties was
                        McLeod’s most prized prop. “I went all the way to Party
                        City to get this beautiful pink cupcake piñata that I
                        wanted to be this crown jewel of the film,” said McLeod.
                        But alas, an at first unseen pair of hands of a crew
                        member holding the piñata in place were just inside the
                        frame and had to be cropped in postproduction, much to
                        McLeod’s dismay. “You see it...but the top part of it is
                        kind of cut off.”

                        " Once she began editing the film, McLeod was forced to
                        make many more tough decisions. Slow motion is integral
                        to the film’s style, but it led to an initial cut of the
                        film because it was twice as long as intended and
                        monotonous in pacing. The majority of the shots in the
                        film had to be shortened to some degree, leaving McLeod
                        in a cycle of editing the footage and showcasing it to
                        close friends to put together a coherent film. “My
                        concern was asking people, ‘Do you know what’s going on?
                        What do you think this is about?’ And finally on my
                        fifth or sixth round people starting giving me the same
                        answers so I felt good about that.”

                        Now the cameras and lights are all safely back in Logan,
                        and most of the cast and crew are studying for finals.
                        The apartment has returned to a comfortable room
                        temperature, with natural light coming in from covered
                        windows instead of red-tinted spotlights. But that
                        miniature world made in there still exists. Now it will
                        just be on a movie screen.
