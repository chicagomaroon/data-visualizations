# The Chicago Maroon’s Data Contribution and Style Guide

## Contribution Standards

### Pull Request Titles

They should be written in the present imperative tense. Examples of that tense are:
"Fix issue in the dispatcher where…", "Improve our handling of…", etc."

### Pull Request Information

All pull requests should contain a still of the image and be linted, minified, contain no more imports than needed, and approved by at least one of the Lead Developers.

## Style Standards

### Font

The font is set via the [`main.css`](./static/main.css) file. The default font, and the one used on the rest of _The Chicago Maroon_, is Georgia, serif font: [Link](https://www.cssfontstack.com/Georgia).

-   They should not take up more than one line each.
-   They should be centered, not left or right-justified.
-   Links should be added using [anchor tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a).
