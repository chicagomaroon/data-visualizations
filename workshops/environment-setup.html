                The <i>Maroon's</i> Data & Technology team uses a variety of
                software to produce high-quality, interactive data
                visualizations. This document will introduce you to our
                development environment and guide you through downloading the
                necessary software. These tools can be quite complex, so don't
                worry if you don't get it right away. No prior experience is
                required, and please feel free to reach out to us at
                <a href="mailto:data@chicagomaroon.com"
                    >data@chicagomaroon.com</a
                >
                if you have any questions!
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">The Terminal</h2>

            <p>
                The Terminal is a program on your computer designed to let you
                interact with files, code, programs, and more at a low level.
                You do all of this by running commands. Thus, the Terminal is an
                example of a Command Line Interface (CLI).
            </p>

            <p>
                The Terminal works within your computer's file system. When you
                open it, it will display a mostly blank screen with a single
                line where you can type. This line will look different depending
                on what type of computer you're using, but it will always
                display a location in your file system. This is your "working
                directory" ("directory" is a synonym of "file" in this context).
            </p>

            <p>
                Try typing <code>pwd</code> and hitting "enter". This stands for
                "Print Working Directory", and it should have printed a line of
                text showing your current location in more detail.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, try <code>ls</code>! This command, short for "List", prints
                the contents of your current working directory. For example, if
                I ran <code>ls</code> in my "Maroon_Data_Viz" folder, the
                Terminal would list folders like "2024", "node_modules", and
                "template_visual", along with files like "CONTRIB.md",
                "example-graphs.html", and "package.json". If your working
                directory is empty, it will print nothing.
            </p>

            <p>
                The final command you need in order to navigate the Terminal is
                <code>cd</code>, or "Change Directory". As its name suggests,
                This command lets you change your working directory. If my
                working directory is "2024" in the Maroon file system, I can
                navigate to a sub-folder using
                <code>cd [folder-name]</code> (for example,
                <code>cd fgli-map</code>). I can also navigate to my working
                directory's parent folder using <code>cd ..</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Using <code>pwd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>cd</code>,
                you can go anywhere in your computer's file system! Take a few
                minutes to mess around with these commands to make sure you're
                comfortable with them (don't worry, you won't break anything).
                The Terminal can do much more, but these are the three basic
                commands you'll need for now. Later, we'll go through some
                commands specific to software we use.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Code Editors</h2>

            <p>
                As the name suggests, code editors are apps that let you edit
                code on your computer. Like Word, they allow you to open and
                edit text-based documents.
            </p>

            <p>
                For a popular, free, all-purpose code editor, try Visual Studio
                Code, or VSCode (download
                <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">here</a>). If
                you want an editor that's more specific to web development
                (which is much of what we do here), try Webstorm (download
                <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">here</a>), a
                powerful JavaScript IDE (integrated development environment).
                This will offer all sorts of configuration options as well as
                thorough documentation for any and all relevant features. You
                can get a free student license
                <a
                    href="https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students"
                    >as a student at UChicago</a
                >.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop</h2>

            <p>
                Git is the most widely used version management software. Once
                you download Git, you can set up a "Git repository" in one of
                your existing folders. This will allow you to run Terminal
                commands to track your changes, create and switch between
                different versions of your code (called "branches"), and cleanly
                combine changes made on different branches. For more detailed
                information about Git, see
                <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">this book</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please download Git here:
                <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"
                    >https://git-scm.com/downloads</a
                >
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="github.com">GitHub</a> is a widely used system that
                extends Git to allow for collaboration on a Git repository. Our
                team hosts its code in a collection of public repositories found
                <a href="https://github.com/chicagomaroon">here</a>. Through
                GitHub, you can download (or "clone") a new repository, make
                changes, and upload (or "push") those changes. When you clone a
                repository, you tell Git to copy the repository's contents into
                a specified folder on your computer. Later, you can "pull"
                others' changes to the shared ("remote") repository, and when
                you edit the code (and save your changes) in your "local"
                repository, you can push them to the "remote". You can also
                create and publish branches for others to see/edit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please create a GitHub account at
                <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You can use your
                personal and/or UChicago email address, but be aware that if you
                only connect your UChicago account, your GitHub may disappear
                after graduation. When you are done, please send us your
                username so we can add you as a contributor.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although you can use Git and GitHub through commands in the
                Terminal, we don't recommend using them that way. Instead, you
                can download an app called "GitHub Desktop" to perform all of
                the Git/GitHub tasks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please download GitHub Desktop
                <a href="https://desktop.github.com/download/">here</a>. Then,
                clone our
                <a href="https://github.com/chicagomaroon/data-visualizations"
                    >Data Visualization repository</a
                >
                by going to "Current Repository > Add > Clone Repository > URL",
                entering the URL
                "https://github.com/chicagomaroon/data-visualizations.git", and
                choosing an empty folder on your computer where you want the new
                repository to go.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you want to contribute to our repository, create a branch
                using the "Current Branch" menu in GitHub Desktop, make your
                changes using your favorite code editor, select the files whose
                changes you want to push using the left-hand-side menu, commit
                those changes (using present imperative tense to title your
                Commit), and push those changes using the top-right button.
                Then, go to our repository in GitHub and open a
                <a
                    href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request"
                    >pull request</a
                >
                asking to merge your branch into the main one. This will start a
                conversation in GitHub where admins can provide feedback,
                approve your changes, and merge your branch. We will review this
                process again in a future workshop.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Node.js</h2>

            <p>
                <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a> is a complex piece
                of software that allows us to use custom scripts to perform
                specific tasks in our repository. For example, if you run
                <code>npm run format</code> ("NPM" = "Node Package Manager") in
                the Terminal in our repository, Node will run a program on the
                entire repository that applies a standard format to everything.
                These scripts are an integral part of our team's workflow. We'll
                go through them in more detail later.
            </p>

            <p>
                To download Node.js, go
                <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager">here</a
                >. NOTE: Please download Node version 20.9.0 by running
                <code>nvm install v20.9.0</code> instead of
                <code>nvm install 22</code>.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">HighCharts</h2>

            <p>
                <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/">HighCharts</a> is a
                JavaScript library used to make high-quality, interactive data
                visualizations that can be embedded into websites with
                relatively little effort. See
                <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/demo">this page</a> for
                examples of what HighCharts can do. Most of our graphs are made
                through HighCharts. We will discuss how to make graphs like this
                in future workshops.
            </p>

            <p>You don't need to download anything to use HighCharts.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Review</h2>

            <p>
                Now, you should understand the basics of navigating the
                Terminal, how to use a code editor, how Git and GitHub work, and
                what we use Node and HighCharts for. You also should have
                successfully downloaded VSCode or Webstorm, Git, GitHub Desktop,
                and Node. To check VSCode/Webstorm and GitHub Desktop, find
                those apps on your computer. To check Git, go to the Terminal
                (it doesn't matter what your working directory is) and run
                <code>git --version</code>. To check Node and NPM, run
                <code>node --version</code> and <code>npm --version</code>,
                respectively. If any of these commands give you an error, please
                reach out to us for assistance.
