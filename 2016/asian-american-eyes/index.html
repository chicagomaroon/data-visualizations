                                launching a Humans of New York–style photo essay

                                “We realized that being political about
                                Asian-American identity isn’t something that a
                                lot of people here are comfortable with yet, so
                                it was easier to create a safe space where
                                people could explore their Asian-American
                                identity and think about their stories without
                                reframing it as this activist-y, political
                                thing. We want people to think about it in that
                                way, but that’s not something that we want to
                                pressure them to do,” Yoon said.

                                town in California. While both of her parents
                                are Chinese, she recently returned from a trip
                                to Korea, which inspired her contribution to
                                this showcase. Her untitled black-and-white
                                marker drawing depicts the face of an indistinct
                                Asian girl. Peonies caress her cheeks—a
                                nurturing gesture that Huang translates as the
                                implicit love, loyalty, and respect that Asians,
                                particularly Asian families, share for one
                                another.

                                Fourth-year Sean Whang, a soft-spoken biology
                                major and visual arts minor descending from an
                                unusual legacy of both doctors and artists,
                                approached this assignment through a different
                                lens. Rather than execute outward explanation,
                                Whang chose to embark on an inward journey of
                                acceptance. In *Lonely at the Top*, drawn on his
                                tablet using Photoshop CS2, Whang addresses the
                                pressures—culturally exacerbated and
                                self-wrought—that drive him to compete with his
                                peers.

                                “It’s always going to be like this,” Whang said.
                                “But even in this reality, it’s still possible
                                to find freedom and still find peace despite all
                                of the pressures and comparisons.”

                                This work marks one of Whang’s first attempts to
                                break from his formal training as a realist
                                portraitist to digital sketching. The risk was
                                an indubitable success: Whang’s combination of
                                unnatural color and digital mapping achieves a
                                supremely magical realist effect. He
                                crystallizes the ephemeral aura of his piece
                                with an accompanying C. S. Lewis quote: “If I
                                find in myself a desire which no experience in
                                this world can satisfy, the most probable
                                explanation is that I was made for another
                                world.”

                                “You belong at an intermediary,” said third-year
                                Catherine Chen, summarizing her perception of
                                the Asian-American experience. This
                                American-born economics major was raised by her
                                grandparents in China until the age of seven,
                                when she returned to the United States. Her
                                project, a large acrylic canvas painting of
                                Chinese calligraphy, serves two functions.
                                First, it depicts the sentiments of three
                                successive generations of her family, beginning
                                with those of her grandparents when they first
                                immigrated to the U.S. Second, it reflects
                                Chen’s own understanding of how people perceive
                                her.

                                “Growing up in China and then here, it’s made me
                                aware of how I feel like I could be a part of
                                both places but not really either. For example,
                                in the U.S. we’re considered Asian, but in
                                China, when people find out I’m from America,
                                they call me American,” Chen said.

                                Chen explained how her close friends would
                                commend her for her work, admiring her skillful
                                knack for writing Chinese characters. Chen’s
                                sister, on the other hand, chided Chen for her
                                sloppy costuming of culture—she didn’t even
                                write out the characters. She had to trace them
                                out and then fill them in with paint. While
                                those half-blind to Asian identity assumed her
                                to be foreign, those who can read Chen’s words
                                can see through the façade.

                                The Lindsey Jay’s diptych, a favorite of Yoon’s,
                                placed alongside Whang’s massive printed
                                drawing, reflects on this same theme of duality.
                                Meanwhile, second-year Helen Zhang’s
                                illustration-board cutout, titled *Exercise in
                                Cultural Exploration and Egotism,* combines the
                                ancient Chinese paper-cutting art of *Jianzhi *
                                with a nod to stereotypically Western
                                Renaissance portraiture. Yet amidst a sea of
                                drawings and paintings, the work of second-year
