                        Homelessness poses a significant burden on the South
                        Side of Chicago and is a primarily socio-economic
                        problem attributed to low wages and a lack of affordable
                        housing. The high cost of living, coupled with high
                        unemployment rates and low-wage jobs, forces individuals
                        to choose amongst food, housing and other expenses.
                        According to the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human
                        Services’ 2015 guidelines, poverty line incomes are set
                        at $11,770 for one person, and $28,410 for a family of
                        five. Englewood, a neighborhood directly west of the
                        University of Chicago’s campus, has a per-capita income
                        of $11,993.

                        It then surprises no one when they are told that the
                        South Side of Chicago is home to a large proportion of
                        Chicago homeless. But who are the homeless, and what are
                        their stories? <em>The Maroon</em> asked both former and
                        currently homeless individuals about their experiences,
                        and performed an investigation into what students are
                        currently doing to combat homelessness.

                        The City of Chicago, through the Department of Family
                        and Support Services, conducted its latest Homeless
                        Count &amp; Survey on the night of January 22, 2014,
                        during one of the most severe winters in the history of
                        Chicago. Despite constant frostbite and hypothermia
                        warnings, and subzero temperatures, the number of
                        homeless individuals remained high, falling from 1,219
                        in 2013 to 965 in 2014. According to a January 23, 2014
                        WBEZ article which covered the count, one explanation
                        given was that some people consider their street space
                        as their home and would rather weather harsh conditions
                        to keep it.

                        Pierre Tatum, a 54-year-old black man and Chicago native
                        who has been homeless since 2003, also expressed such
                        feelings of ownership for his part of the street. “I’m a
                        street vendor, and I have a spot on 53rd and Blackstone
                        where I sell stuff from down the alley or people that
                        donate to the Second Faith Church.” Prior to 2003, he
                        was an employee at a warehouse before the company moved
                        to California. After his father passed away, the
                        building in which he lived was vacated due to structural
                        damages which had not been addressed, and he has been
                        without a home since. He filed a suit against the
                        federal government, holding it liable for forcing him
                        into homelessness.

                        more financially beneficial to remain on the streets.
                        “My father’s attorney said ‘Me, personally? I would stay
                        outside because you’ll get more money...if you’re
                        working and over the poverty level, you’ll lose
                        dividends from the court.’ By me not having a home, I
                        could not get a steady job because I don’t have a
                        permanent address.” The suit is still ongoing.

                        Tatum’s path from employment to chronic homelessness is
                        a common one. “Prior to becoming homeless, I had my own
                        business. I was making ten million dollars a year in
                        sales, selling clothes, jewelry, cologne, you name it,”
                        said Gerald Casey, the director of outreach and
                        volunteer coordinator for Pacific Garden Mission, which
                        is an emergency shelter located in East Pilsen. While a
                        student at Olive-Harvey College, Casey was a business
                        and accounting major. He opened a successful sales
                        business that took a turn for the worst in July of 2005,
                        when his life spiraled out of control. “I lost
                        everything I had…my marriage went south on me, my
                        teenagers were acting up, and I had fallen into a state
                        of depression.”

                        Casey’s grandmother and first wife also passed away
                        during that time. He describes the experience as lonely,
                        as his family and children kept their distance from him
                        after trying numerous times to help. Resorting to
                        drinking, marijuana and crack cocaine, Casey said that
                        substance use is a culturally ingrained form of coping.
                        Furthermore, Casey emphasized how experiences with

                        incestuous nature, are shared among many that come to
                        the shelter.

                        “I was sexually molested as an infant by my auntie, my
                        female cousin and my uncle. Furthermore, beer was placed
                        in my baby bottle to put me to sleep at times. So, you
                        know, by the time I was 10 years old…as a kid growing up

                        Casey was homeless for a year before finding a home at
                        Pacific Garden Mission. The transition from business
                        owner to shelter-seeker was excruciating, and Casey said
                        that most homeless individuals are almost never seen in
                        public areas because they are embarrassed by their
                        situation. “I didn’t want to be [at Pacific Garden
                        Mission], because my view of Pacific Garden Mission was
                        that it was a place for bums. My pride ran so strongly
                        in me, telling me ‘I’m not a bum’, but I was one…I just
                        couldn’t lower myself to coming there,” Casey said.
                        Though he was able to climb out of his depression with
                        the help of Pacific Garden Mission, many at the shelter
                        have more debilitating mental diseases that confine them
                        in perpetual homelessness.

                        previous Governor, Pat Quinn, closed down all the
                        facilities. So where are they to go?”

                        Arlene Roberts, a current resident at Pacific Garden
                        Mission, is a 52-year-old former nursing home assistant
                        who has been homeless for 3 years following a domestic
                        dispute with her husband. Originally from Rockford,
                        Illinois, Roberts says that even though she does not
                        have a history of substance abuse or mental illness, her
                        lack of a state identification resulted in her chronic
                        unemployment.

                        Washington Park, but I’ve been staying at the Mission
                        because it’s safer for a woman, because there’s a lot of
                        rape and crime here,” Roberts said. “I’ve been robbed
                        and everything, but I can’t let that stop me. I got to
                        live on, and I feel like something good’s about to
                        happen.” She said that she recently acquired a social
                        worker who will be helping her find a studio apartment
                        as well as employment. When asked about other homeless
                        individuals that <em>The Maroon</em> interviewed, such
                        as Jeff and Georgia, her face lit up as if beloved
                        family members were mentioned. “Georgia! Yeah, and
                        Jeff!” Roberts said. “I know all of them.”

                        What help have students provided?

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Of the homeless individuals interviewed, none could
                        recall a student group that provided consistent help to
                        the homeless population. <em>The Maroon</em> spoke with
                        Elizabeth Weigel, who is the associate director of
                        Calvert House and adviser for The Homeless Food Run,
                        which appears to be the only student organization
                        dedicated solely to helping the homeless. Founded in
                        2002, The Homeless Food Run delivers food to various
                        locations via a service truck on Tuesday evenings each
                        week. “On average [we have about] 10 students a week
                        [volunteering], and [each week there are] different
                        students. There are maybe 2 students there, all the
                        time, running it…and sometimes they do extra runs when
                        fraternities and sororities contact us to do service
                        projects,” Weigel said.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        She said that The Homeless Food Run, as well as other
                        groups such as the on-campus Christian InterVarsity,
                        which does food runs, Hyde Park Food Pantry, and The
                        Living Room Café address not only homelessness but also
                        food insecurity in general: a problem relevant to both
                        those who are homeless and impoverished. “There’s a lot
                        of people who are food insecure, and there’s a lot of
                        resources for people like that,” Weigel said.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Despite some student involvement in food runs, Weigel
                        feels that there may not be as big of a culture of
                        service on campus. “We do get surges of people, but it’s
                        typically to fulfill hours either for their fraternity
                        or sorority…it isn’t something that’s like ‘all my
                        classmates are doing it, and we feel compelled to do
                        it,’” Weigel said, though she recognizes that there are
                        many programs which students are actively involved in,
                        such as Summer Links, which works with non-profits over
                        the summer, and Neighborhood Schools Program. However,
                        she feels there could be more community-centered
                        involvement from students, especially since the campus
                        is situated so closely to the poorest south side
                        neighborhoods.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        “Students could help us with bus passes or clothes
                        during the winter, so we can change our clothes. And
                        toiletries,” Roberts said, suggesting that these could
                        be more useful than the occasional dollar, and can be
                        acquired from donations to shelters.

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        “One of my dreams is to have a student soup kitchen or
                        whatever the need is in the neighborhood…like a student
                        run shelter.” Weigel said. “Some of the SSA [Social
                        Service Administration] students could help with people
                        who need housing or [solving] questions that may be
                        difficult to answer. Some of the funding could come from
                        the University and donations come from students. Think
                        of all the dorms, old apartments or stuff that people
                        don’t want!” She believes that there are churches in
                        Hyde Park that are looking for ways to serve the
                        community, and could be close enough for students to
                        open a shelter.

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Casey agreed that there are plenty of volunteer and
                        service opportunities for students at the University to
                        initiate, and emphasized the importance and
                        gratification inherent to giving back to his community.
