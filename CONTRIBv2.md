# Contributors Guide
Interested in writing a story with the Maroon Data Team? Follow the steps below.

1. If you are new, please complete all the [getting started](#from-the-very-beginning) steps.
2. Claim a story on the pitch document (see Slack channel for pitch list) or pitch a new story. To pitch a new story, fill out [Data Team Story Outline](link) and send to a Data Editor for review.
3. Research, write, and create necessary visuals for your story. Feel free to create draft visuals using any program or language that you would like. Published visuals will need to be created by following the [build process](#build-process-for-a-visualization). Any visuals that do not follow the build process must be approved by a data editor. Visuals must follow the Maroon's Data [Style Guide](#style-guide).

## Getting Started

### Setup
1. Make a Github account and learn about version control (git). 
    - Make an account with github if you do not have one: https://github.com/join
    - You may also want to download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), which will allow you to manage repositories on your computer using a graphical user interface, and work with any code environments on your computer (e.g. VSCode, WebStorm, etc.)
    - There are lots of resources to learn about version control using Github. Below are a few we recommend but we encourage you to exploring other online resources as needed.
        - Version Control by [The Missing Semester from MIT](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/)
        - [CAPP Camp Git I and Git II](https://uchicago-capp30121-aut-2022.github.io/capp-camp/s2-git-i/)
        - [GitHub Feature Branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
        - [GitHub Pull Requests](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request)

2. Clone the `data-visualization` repo locally.
    - Learn more about cloning [here](https://uchicago-capp30121-aut-2022.github.io/capp-camp/s3-git-ii/1-working-from-multiple-locations.html#using-git-clone)

3. Download a code editor
    - If you do not have a strong opinion about which code editor to use, download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (often just called VS Code). If you do have a strong opinion, feel free to use your preferred choice.
        - learn more about code editors generally [here](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/)
        - learn more about VS Code [here](https://uchicago-capp30121-aut-2022.github.io/capp-camp/s1-linux/2-vs-code-layout.html)

4. Download node which will allow you to run Javascript, the programming language we use to write our visualizations in:
    - [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) `v20.9.0`
        - To install the correct version, open the terminal and run:
            1. Install [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) with `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash` . If you are getting error "should not accept aliases with slashes" (likely if you are on Windows) try using `nvm-setup.exe` from the [Windows release site](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases).
            2. Install the correct version of Node `nvm install 20.9.0`. If you are getting error of nvm not recognized then run `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh` and then run above again. 
            3. Set this version as the default by running `nvm alias default 20.9.0` and `nvm use 20.9.0`
            4. Confirm the correct version is installed by running `node -v`. This should return `v20.9.0`

5. After you have cloned the repo and downloaded Node, go to the base folder of the `data-visualizations` repository and run the command `npm ci` to install all package dependencies. You will only need to do this once

### Tools and Skills to Review
Programming is a skill that you learn by doing. There is no expectation that someone fully understands a programming language or package before they can start creating things. Much of the process is about learning as you go and building a muscle of problem solving and debugging as you go.

With that being said, use the resources below as a starting place and reference source. Aim to learn just enough to jump into a project and learn the rest as you go. 

- We primarily use [`HighCharts`](https://www.highcharts.com/), a JavaScript library, to build visualizations. Each HighChart graphic is embedded on a simple HTML page that is linked in its parent story.
    - The best place to start is to find a previously created visual from the Maroon Team by opening [example-graphs.html](./example-graphs.html) from your local repository. This will have example charts and links to the accompanying code to review. When creating a data visualization, finding a chart similar to what you’re trying to develop and working off the existing JavaScript code linked.
    - If there is not an example similar to what you want to create, review the [`Demos` tab](https://www.highcharts.com/demo/) on the Highcharts website and review the code. You can find the code for that specific visual under the `View Code` or `Copy JS code` tabs under the visualization.
    - Continue to [Build Process for a Visualization](#build-process-for-a-visualization)
- Other tools include:
    - Google Sheets: Often the best tool to work with csv's or any tabular data is Google Sheets. You can review, filter, and pivot the data as well as make draft visuals
    - R and Python; For more data intensive projects, you may want to consider using R or Python. See examples in the [data-analysis](https://github.com/chicagomaroon/data-visualizations/tree/main/data-analysis) folder.
    - For mapping, we have used [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), an open-source JavaScript library, for mobile-friendly interactive maps. 
    - For more customizable, interactive visualizations, [D3.js](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery?utm_source=d3js-org&utm_medium=nav&utm_campaign=try-observable) has become a popular package. There is a steep learning curve for this tool but gives you total control over your visuals. Ask Austin if you are interested in learning more. (More resources TK).

See the [resources][resources/] folder for additional material.

## Build Process for a Visualization 
1. Go to the base folder of the `data-visualizations` repository and ensure your local repo is up to date with the remote repo by running `git checkout main` and `git pull`
2. Create a branch for your story by running `git checkout -b '[kebab-case-story-name]'`. Replace the values in brackets with the relevant names. Read more about kebab-case [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/programming-naming-conventions-explained#what-is-kebab-case).
2. In the terminal run `npm run create-visual --year=[year] --story=[kebab-case-story-name]`  This will create a folder with all the necessary files to create your visual.
    - If it is the year `2024` and your story is called `Example Visual` then run the command `npm run create-visual --year=2023 --story=example-visual` using the year `2024` and your story's name `example-visual` in kebab-case.
    - For the error `The syntax of the command is incorrect`, use ChatGPT to edit the command for your terminal. For example, Git Bash requires line breaks. You may also have to manually set environment variables with `npm_config_year=` and `npm_config_story=`.
    - In your `./[year]/[story-name]/` folder, there will be a file called `main.js`. This is where you’ll write the JavaScript logic for your visual.
3. Start creating your visual that will be housed in the `./[year]/[story-name]/` folder.
    - If you'd like to see previously created example visuals, open [example-graphs.html](./example-graphs.html) from your local repository.
    - If you are using Highcharts, here is a lot of helpful documentation on the [options for creating charts](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/).
4. Update the `meta_data.json` in your story's folder, which will look something like this:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Example Visual",
     "description": "Describe your visual"
   }
   ```
    - Make sure the title you write in the `meta_data.json` file is the same as the title you give your visual in `main.js` and in `index.html`'s `<title>` tag.
5. Run `npm run lint` and make the changes that the output recommends.
6. Go to the base folder of the `data-visualizations` repository and run the command `npm run process-visual --year=[year] --story=[kebab-case-story-name]`
   - Example: `npm run process-visual --year=2023 --story=example-visual`
7. Create a Pull Request to have your visual reviewed by committing and pushing your changes.
    - You can run `git status` to see which files in red have not been added. Then run `git add [file-name]` for each file to add them. Next run `git commit -m '[commit message]'` to commit your changes. Then run `git push` to push your changes. If this is your first commit, github may ask you to run a different command, which you should. Ex `git push --set-upstream origin [branch-name]`

## The Chicago Maroon’s Data Contribution and Style Guide

### Contribution Standards

#### Pull Request Titles

They should be written in the present imperative tense. Examples of that tense are:
"Fix issue in the dispatcher where…", "Improve our handling of…", etc."

#### Pull Request Information

All pull requests should contain a still of the image and be linted, minified, contain no more imports than needed, and approved by at least one of the Lead Developers.

### Style Standards

Examples for updated style guides
- [Urban Institute](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/graphics-styleguide/)
- [BBC](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/)
