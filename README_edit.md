# Welcome to the *Chicago Maroon*'s Data and Technology Repository!

Our team supports the *Maroon*'s journalism by producing data visualizations, our own data-focused stories, and internal 
technical projects. See all of our stories [here](https://chicagomaroon.com/category/data/) or read selected stories:
- [University Faculty Aren’t Neutral When It Comes to Political Donations](https://chicagomaroon.com/41302/grey-city/university-faculty-arent-neutral-when-it-comes-to-political-donations/)
- [The Maroon Launches UChicago Police Department Incident Reporter](https://chicagomaroon.com/41255/grey-city/the-maroon-launches-uchicago-police-department-incident-reporter/)

Our team makes use of a variety of JavaScript tools to create web-based journalistic data visualizations embedded in the
*Maroon*'s online articles. Most notably, we use [HighCharts](https://www.highcharts.com/), a JavaScript module designed
for simple, interactive data visualization in a variety of formats. For map-based visualizations, we use HighCharts, 
[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/) or [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript). For custom visualizations we use [d3.js](https://d3js.org/). Individual projects have made use of various tools such as Google Sheets, Python and R. to perform data-related tasks including general data.

## Interested in joining?

The *Maroon*'s Data Team is an excellent place to learn new tools while developing extracurricular skills in data 
collection, analysis, and storytelling. Many of our team members join with little to no experience in any of these 
systems. We provide a flexible, low-stakes environment with ample support for new members to learn, grow, and publish a 
final product they can be proud of. If you are interested in joining our team, please fill out 
[the *Maroon*'s interest form](https://chicagomaroon.com/apply/) and we will reach out to get to know you and find a 
meaningful project you would like to work on. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to one or both 
of the team's Lead Developers, [Nikhil Patel](nvp15@uchicago.edu) and [Austin Steinhart](asteinhart@uchicago.edu).
