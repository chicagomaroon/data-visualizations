                    In the past two years, several high-profile events have
                    roiled campuses nationwide and caused increased scrutiny on
                    university endowments. In 2023, campus organizers pressed
                    for divestment from Israeli companies in response to the
                    genocide in Gaza. Starting with President Trump's
                    inauguration in January, once-reliable federal funding has
                    become uncertain, causing many to believe universities
                    should draw from their endowments to make up the loss. More
                    generally, since elite universities overhauled their
                    investment strategies starting around 1985, endowments have
                    ballooned to controversial levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It seems like everyone suddenly has an opinion about
                    endowments. But for the less Booth-inclined, this piece aims
                    to answer: what is an endowment, exactly? How does it work?
                    Who controls it? And why should we care? Answering these
                    questions is not easy for the University of Chicago, because
                    private universities have minimal reporting requirements and
                    are accountable mainly to their stakeholders rather than to
                    the public at large. Still, the beginnings of a picture can
                    be developed from what little information exists.

                    The Maroon's data desk compiled datasets from three publicly
                    available sources (XXX do we list what sources) to build the
                    fullest picture to date of the University's endowment, which
                    is one of the 20 largest private university endowments in
                    the United States.

                        University endowments are separate from student tuition.
                        That's because universities' income consists of many
                        sources with different restrictions. Tuition goes
                        towards day-to-day operating expenses without getting
                        invested; endowments, on the other hand, stem from
                        private donors and are managed by investors.

                        At UChicago, donations are funneled into a pot called
                        the Total Return Investment Pool, or TRIP. The TRIP is
                        in turn invested into various equities and assets. The
                        major distinction here is between public equities--what
                        most people think of as "stocks"--and private equities,
                        which involve individual donors, venture capitalists,
                        and hedge funds. Because stock exchanges are regulated
                        by the federal government, more data is available on
                        public equities compared to private equities.

                        Universities withdraw a percentage from this endowment
                        to cover their remaining costs after tuition and other
                        revenue are accounted for, about 4-5% per year. The
                        remainder of the endowment is re-invested. In 2024, the
                        University withdrew 5% of its endowment to support
                        operating costs.

                    <p>
                        Most of a university's endowment is typically
                        restricted, which means that donors have put rules
                        around what their donation can be used for. For example,
                        the Pearson family moved to withdraw their funds from
                        the Pearson Institute at UChicago due to alleged
                        contract breaches in 2018.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        X% of UChicago's endowment consists of restricted funds.
                        Still, well-endowed universities don't have their hands
                        completely tied. "They should make clear that their
                        formidable financial endowments are not there to simply
                        be envied or admired," wrote Larry H. Summers earlier
                        this year. "Part of their function is to be drawn down
                        in the face of emergencies, and covering federal funding
                        lapses surely counts as one. Believe me, a former
                        president of Harvard, when I say that ways can be found
                        in an emergency to deploy even parts of the endowment
                        that have been earmarked by their donors for other
                        uses."

                        UChicago's endowment was valued at $10.4 billion in
                        2024, the equivalent of 1.3 years' worth of revenue and

                        UChicago is a private university. This means that while
                        it must comply with general financial reporting
                        requirements for nonprofits, it is not subject to the
                        more stringent requirements for public universities. It
                        has incentive to keep all this behind closed doors:
                        information about investment strategies would give
                        institutions a competitive edge over their peers. This
                        is one reason why universities have in the past refused
                        to comply with activists' demands for transparency,
                        although the University has on some occasions fulfilled
                        narrower requests. When the Associated Press asked 50
                        public and private universities to provide information
                        about their endowments, 39 schools refused and 4 did not
                        respond. Even Congress has failed to glean information
                        about endowments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Still, even for a private university, UChicago is
                        exceptional: in 2023, Amnesty International rated the
                        University as the least transparent among 10 peer
                        institutions, with a score of 0 out of 40. The
                        University appears to have stopped publishing even its
                        Annual Report since 2022.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All universities do have some information available, if
                        one knows where to look.

                        The Securities and Exchanges Commission requires all
                        entities with significant investments to report on the

                        Data compiled from the past 20 years of financial
                        reports reveals that the University has been
                        increasingly investing in private equities over time.

                        For decades, campus groups wishing to influence the
                        University's finances have held protests targeting
                        either the Board of Trustees or the University
                        President, both to little success. To understand why
                        organizers target these two groups, it may help to take
                        a look at the flowchart below.

                        As this chart demonstrates, the Board of Trustees is
                        ultimately the final decisionmaker about investment
                        approaches. The Board of Trustees acts as a steering
                        committee for the Office of Investments, which is
                        responsible for overseeing the endowment and answers to
                        the President. The campus community has three avenues
                        for giving input to investment strategy: the Faculty
                        Senate, a board comprising 51 elected faculty; the
                        Graduate Council, with 6 executive members and elected
                        representatives from the 12 graduate divisions; and
                        Advisory Councils, which have 10-95 members across 14
                        committees composed of "friends and alumni" of the
                        University. None of these bodies currently have regular
                        meetings with the Board of Trustees, although the
                        Graduate Council held a quarterly "Student Perspectives
                        Series" with the Board from 2016-2021.

                        The Office of Investments hires and communicates with
                        external asset management firms. "Often, even the
                        institutions themselves don’t know where their money
                        goes, in part because they hire outside managers who
                        constantly buy and sell investments. Additionally, many
                        schools put their money into mutual or hedge funds,
                        which in turn make other investments that can be kept
                        confidential," reported the Associated Press in 2016.

                    <p>
                        But ignorance is a choice, not a rule. According to
                        Brenden O'Connell, an employee of a hedge-fund firm that
                        manages university endowments, any institution with a
                        separately managed account (SMA) can request
                        restrictions on their investments. "An SMA would be
                        customized for you, usually. So you can impose
                        constraints, [such as] you don't want exposure to XYZ
                        industries, and then the manager will tailor the
                        portfolio accordingly". For example, UChicago could
                        easily request that its endowment is not invested in
                        fossil-fuel companies. Harvard did exactly this in 2021.

                        Similarly, former Trustee Tom Cole appeared to deflect
                        responsibility for decisions regarding investments.
                        Notes from a 2016 meeting summarized his remarks: "It
                        would be unusual for a discussion of a potential Kalven
                        exception to emerge from within the Board itself.
                        Rather, it is the role of the president and the officers
                        to transmit issues of concern to the trustees and that
                        discussions subsequently occur at the Executive
                        Committee level and then might come before the entire
                        Board."

                    <p>
                        Yet according to the official governing documents of the
                        University of Chicago, as of May 2024, the President is
                        actually "responsible, under the supervision of the
                        Board, for the management of…investments, investment
                        properties, and special property holdings in the
                        neighborhood of the University" (emphasis added for
                        clarity). In a 2015 interview, then-President Zimmer
                        conceded: "Investments are the responsibility of the
                        Board of Trustees…this is a Board matter, but if I had
                        to report on my sense of the Board’s view of this—is
                        that they’re unlikely to want to do that."

                        donation cannot be used for a particular purpose, then
                        the Office of Investments must comply.

                    Amid all the recent concerns about the University's
                    finances, whether through the lens of divestment, federal
                    funding, or responsibility, the University has held
                    steadfast in its refusal to share information with its
                    campus community. In this emerging environment, it may
                    benefit members of campus to become more familiar with just
                    what goes on behind the scenes in the University of
                    Chicago's very deep pockets.

                    <blockquote>
                        I believe the protesters should also consider that an
                        encampment, with all the etymological connections of the
                        word to military origins, is a way of using force of a
                        kind rather than reason to persuade others. For a short
                        period of time, however, the impact of a modest
                        encampment does not differ so much from a conventional
                        rally or march.
