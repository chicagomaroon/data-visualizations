I think it’ll be hard, given the composition of the board of trustees, taking a stance on that could have an impact on their business strategies. In a way, we are established by the Rockefellers, who used oil, but it’s a hard topic. It’s definitely one I’m very interested in, and I believe that the University of Chicago can send a clear message by taking a stance in divestment, but I’m not really sure about the overall effects, so that’s why it needs to be discussed inside the board of trustees. I’m really excited that the march on Friday got the attention it did, and we will meet with the board of trustees, and I think that’s really important, and we need that kind of dialogue.”</p>

But I do think there is much to be done in how students understand bias. We have had minor incidents inside the school, and we have engaged in discussions between students and the perceptions that we have are totally different. For international students, it’s especially hard, because first it’s not speaking in your own language, and then when you come from a different culture, how do you understand race, how do you understand gender roles, and it’s completely different, so I do think that there needs to be a super-huge push from the University as a whole to better engage the situation.”</p>

Personally, I would obviously love there to be greater resources available, and I think that it’s a key issue within our community. I think in order to build stronger relationships with the local community, that’s something that’s very much necessary. I think from an administrative perspective, I would say we have to be able to utilize our resources in the sense that we are not harming the services we already have. So if we are overextending ourselves in some capacity, then we would not be doing justice to the services we already have and could potentially hurt the programs we already have in place. I think that it’s really thinking about setting up a adult trauma center comes down to strategic planning, and I think the UCMC has taken a lot great initiatives of building out a strategic planning team. They are all former BCG consultants from the health care practice, and I think that’s something that they’re working towards, but it’s not going to be an overnight solution.”</p>

I think that there are a lot of resources, at Booth particularly, around impact investing. Booth is considered to be a leader in impact investing, and I think it would be great to see that more closely aligned with some of the strategic decisions of how the endowment is currently funded. I think that’s an area that I would like to see not only students take a greater leadership in, but also faculty particularly who have a lot of expertise to be a greater voice, and that’s where it comes back to building better relationships across faculty and students. Students alone can’t do it, but faculty have a different level of influence we need to better be able to utilize.”</p>

I think the first step is doing the climate survey, and it’s wonderful to see that change coming out. I think this is another area where the data-driven approach is necessary to be able to take the data from the climate survey, and utilize that information to see a much clearer picture of what this University is doing, both against its own history but as well as it’s peer institutions. And then be able to utilize what are developing best practices for education…it’s not enough to just follow the bare minimum listed from the department of education, but again, it comes back to you have to have a very clear picture of what the issues are right now in the process in order to make those improvements, and you need the data to do that.”</p>

I think that those issues, those experiences, can greatly vary depending on what part of the University you are a part of, and I think one key strategy is to see areas of the school that have significantly stronger results from the survey, and what is it about those particular communities that makes them feel more inclusive, and how do we build that across other areas of the University.
