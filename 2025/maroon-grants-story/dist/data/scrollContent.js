    "Medellín might be familiar to those who have heard of infamous drug kingpin and founder of the Medellín Cartel, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Escobar'>Pablo Escobar</a>. In the decades since the 1980s, when Escobar was growing the international drug trade, the operation has become more domestically concentrated, Blattman explained.",
    'Blattman and his research team, partly based in Colombia, have spent years conducting interviews and developing relationships to “map out the economics and politics” of a network of roughly 400 local drug gangs, he said.',
    'In addition to that qualitative work, researchers piloted a “new experimental counter-intervention program” to curb the recruitment of young boys into the gangs, by longitudinally tracking 10,000 13-year-old boys living in the city’s neighborhoods.',
    'Now, all of that work is continuing “at a much reduced scale and intensity,” Blattman said.',
    'The researchers also had a new idea to tackle extortion, where local gangs provide security in a neighborhood and force stores and households to pay for it.',
    'Blattman and his team wanted the local police to set up “zero extortion zones.” If gangs didn’t respect those guidelines, they would add police presence, without making arrests, in areas where gangs conduct their drug deals.',
    'The hope was that the setup would act as a deterrent, as drug lords would lose more money from unmade drug deals than they had gained from extortion, Blattman said.',
    'He says that the experiment is now entirely on hold.',
    '“[The grant] was going to support us to work with the government to see whether that works,” he said. “Because nobody has answers to extortion.”',
    'Blattman’s grant was cancelled, along with dozens of others, when the Trump administration <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/pentagon-guts-national-security-program-harnessed-social-science">gutted</a> the Department of Defense’s Minerva Research Initiative (MRI). The flagship program began in 2008 and had been funding social science research on misinformation, violent extremism, and more until last spring when its <a href="https://minerva.defense.gov/About/">website</a> went dark, <i>Science</i> reported.',
    "Blattman was relying on the grant to fund his project for the next few years. No one was fired in the short term, but he and his research team “scaled down staff and on our ambitions, and didn't get to grow the projects we wanted to start,” he said.",
    "“We can keep the lights on for a year, but I would say we're not in a position to keep going.”",

    "Roughly 20 percent, or 1 in 5, of the defendants who have been <a href='https://www.npr.org/2021/01/21/958915267/nearly-one-in-five-defendants-in-capitol-riot-cases-served-in-the-military'>prosecuted</a> for Jan. 6 were U.S. military veterans.",
    "“It's double the statistical weight you would be expecting if you just looked more narrowly at their demographics,” he said.",
    'Pape and his research team had been preparing since January 2023 to launch the heart of the project—the survey—before the cancellation.',
    'Pape said that in many studies like his, research builds. If a study is cancelled near its end date, it can mean that the preliminary work is wasted.',
    "You can’t say, ‘Oh, well, they already produced 90 percent of the value of the project,’” he said.  “The problem is, 90 percent of the value of the project's been denied by taking away the critical last phase.”",
    'Characteristics of the veteran population, Pape said, have been largely unstudied. A typical structure for a research project for which little is known about the target demographic involves “a lot of preliminary and mid-level work,” like collecting information on the population and developing survey methodology, “to get the real value out of the later parts of the project.”',
    'The findings were beginning to show that PTSD and other related issues that prevent veterans from reintegrating into society after overseas deployments “were possibly some of the root issues” behind political violence.',
    'This is really something that will come at a potentially direct harm to our veteran community,” he said. “That’s the real sort of tragedy about stopping this research.',
    'A multi-year grant and an integrated research project have detailed expectations about how to make the findings public and submit to journals, which, Pape says, is now “all thrown up in the air.”',
    'Furthermore, cancellations of studies conducted on a largely understudied population have practical implications, Pape explained. In his case, researchers were laying the groundwork for policies that could have improved the quality of life for veterans in the U.S.',
    "Pape said that there have been no layoffs among his researchers. “This was essentially an all-hands-on-deck crisis, and I think we've weathered it really quite well,” he said, explaining that they found outside and private funding sources.",
    "But that doesn't mean that we're going to be able to instantly go back to that ambitious final stage of the research program here that we had,” Pape continued. “Maybe we can in the future."

    "Like many other Ph.D. students, Lutz, a sixth-year computational neuroscience Ph.D. candidate, applied for a grant from the NIH through its <a href='https://grants.nih.gov/funding/activity-codes/F31'>Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award</a> (F31) program in her second year. F31 grants support Ph.D. candidates working on health-related research. She lost roughly $16,000 of a $48,974 grant.",
    'The NIH offered two application tracks for F31 grants: the standard track and the diversity track, for candidates from groups underrepresented in health research fields.',
    '“Once you’re in that [diversity] pool, the scoring and everything is the same for both grants,” Lutz said. “That’s where there’s a lot of confusion—[people] assume that grants that are funded through the diversity mechanism are the ‘diversity hire’ of grants.” In fact, she said, the proposal scoring process is identical.',
    'On May 23, the NIH terminated Lutz’s grant, along with all other grants awarded through the diversity track. “The [termination] letter was so aggressive, and it assumed that my research was DEI-focused, and had this, like, secret DEI agenda,” she said.',
    'Though Lutz could apply again for the same grant via the standard track, the timing of the termination, which comes the year before she will graduate, makes that nearly impossible.',
    '“Best case scenario, if I applied, it would still be, like, eight months until the funding would start,” she said. “I’m planning on defending in a year, and you need to propose having funding for a minimum of two years.”',
    'Other options, like funding from private foundations, are also infeasible given her timing.',
    'Lutz herself will be mostly unaffected—the department of neurobiology is supporting her through the rest of her program and, because the F31 covers student costs rather than research costs, the budget for the project itself remains the same. But those student costs will ultimately fall on and “put more stress” on the department and her lab, she said.'

The data allows a comprehensive “snapshot of the city” at a particularly important moment in Florentine history.",
    'The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) awarded Atkinson and four other Florentine history researchers across multiple institutions a grant for, as he described it, “an experiment in amalgamating digital humanities projects.”',
    '“We came together with five separate projects, which had different agendas, different datasets, different research questions, but they’re all about Florence at a particular time,” he explained.',

    'He and his team wanted to build a digital model that would integrate the research into a “larger, multi-form project that was online-based and was accessible to the public.”',
    'Integrating the five researchers’ work will both connect closely related areas of Florentine history scholarship and allow the resulting resource to grow even after the project end, he said.',

    'The researchers can no longer pay their project manager, fund student assistants, or meet in person in Florence, Atkinson said.',
    '“It’s kind of heartbreaking because these people had committed the next two years of their lives to this,” he said. “Now they’re scrambling to try and fill that funding gap in other ways, which means they have less and less time to devote to this project.”',
    'The Division of Arts & Humanities has been able to fill in for some of the project’s funding—allowing Atkinson to go on a short research trip to Italy and covering some other critical expenses—but does not intend to fully substitute the award.',
