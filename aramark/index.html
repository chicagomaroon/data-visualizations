                    The Life of the Mind has gone global in the last three decades, with international student presence doubling over thirty years to encompass one-fifth of the University’s overall student population. The College has also experienced a steady increase in multiculturalism, with the number of undergraduate international students growing tenfold since 1980, now coming to account for one in every 10 undergraduate students.

The undergraduate international student population grew from 1.14% of the undergraduate population in 1980 to 9.47% in 2013, for an overall increase of 8.33%.

                    Josh Liu is an international outreach intern for the College Admissions Office and a second-year international student from China. Liu attributes this dramatic rise in Chinese international students to an increase in the number of Chinese middle-class families, who are increasingly able to afford to send their children abroad to American universities.
                </p>
                <p class='text body-text'>
                    “With the [Chinese] economy growing so fast…there are more people and more families in the category of ‘middle class.’ They are able to afford their students a better education in the United States. Ten years before, we’ve got a stereotype that people who, after attending high school in China, go to the United States, are people who could not get into a very good college in China for gaokao [the Chinese college entrance exam],” Liu said.</p>

            <div class='col-lg-offset-2 col-lg-6 col-md-offset-1 col-md-8 col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10 col-xs-12'>
                <p class='text body-text'>“Now, the trend is that a lot of the ‘elite’ students from China are going to top-tier American universities. First of all, their families can afford that, and second, people are realizing that the quality of higher education in China is not quite satisfactory. Except for the top-tier schools in China…students’ lives are so laid-back and relaxed. They are not studying, and they cannot get much from their college experience. That’s why a lot of students are coming to the United States,” he added.</p>

                                <p><strong>Can you walk me through the application process?</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>"It’s very obscure because we’re not raised up being taught about colleges and applying there, and the things you need to do to get in to colleges. When we grow up, all we hear is "oh, some brother or some cousin, he went to the States to study,’ and beyond that, there’s not division of what the colleges are like, because each college has its own character. We have no idea about that. Let’s say we’re in the 11th to 12th grade, and it’s like a ton of bricks—there’s all these colleges, and you have to choose. Apparently, there are varying difficulties to get in to, so you just make your decision within a span of 6 months. There are college counselors to help you, but I’d say it’s still tricky because nobody knows what it’s like to actually be in America, and have gone through college there, and come back to Nepal—there’s very few people like that. And my principal did do that to some certain degree, but for me, she just pushed me into applying to top colleges, so I guess I’m here now. It just came down to, I think, UChicago, Dartmouth, and I felt like being exposed to the city was much better than being in a secluded place. I had that feeling in Nepal anyways; it’s like, I could get that feeling in Nepal—if I wanted to seclude myself from cities and human civilization, I could better do that in Nepal than anywhere else."</p>
                                <p><strong>Differences between American and Nepalese universities:</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>"I’d say in Nepal, it’s much more about getting through college, rather than enjoying it. Here in America, the vibe is that college is one of the best days of your life, and in Nepal, college is just first grade, second grade, third grade—it’s just something you need to get by with. It’s gonna be fun, but it’s not anything spectacular or extraordinary. It’s not gonna be the best days of your life, so that’s very different."</p>
                                <p>"The one thing I truly appreciate about the culture here is that women are truly respected…they’re very much equally [respected]—it’s obviously not a perfect society, but it’s much more perfect than what it is in Nepal. And that’s something I like, and it’s something I really appreciate, but at the same time, it’s overwhelming because, in Nepal, you just don’t see women in positions of power. It’s kind of sad, and then here, you see women in all sorts of places, and it’s amazing. It’s also hard to say ‘wow, this is so different, it’s…one thing I think Nepal can learn from."</p>
                                <p><strong>What are your after-graduation plans, both short-term and long-term?</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>"I don’t know what position I am in now, whether I owe any…duty to go back to Nepal and working there. I also feel like now that I’ve seen much, I don’t want to be tied to one place. I certainly don’t want to be tied to America either…I see myself traveling, not staying in one place. Probably having a home in Nepal for sure; I would not want to stay too far from my parents, but I don’t want to stay in the same place, either.</p>

                                <p>"That’s hard. So I was born in Korea, Seoul, Korea, but I lived half of my life in Japan, so I was…5 years in Tokyo and 5 years in Kobe. That’s really unique."

                                    <p><strong>Wow! Can you explain the story behind that?</strong>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>"I’m Korean—my parents are Koreans, so I was born there—and I lived there until I was 9. Then, my dad’s work required him to go abroad to Japan, so that’s why I went to Japan, to Tokyo. We went back briefly to Korea after 5 years, and my dad decided he likes Japan better, so he moved the company, so we all moved back to Japan. But this time he went to Kobe, and we stayed there until now. My family is actually still back there. I haven’t been to Japan for like two years now! I went to Korea last summer, so that’s good. I miss my friends, I miss my family, I miss the food, I miss the atmosphere. I feel like I’m losing my Japanese too! I hope not, but yeah."</p>

                                    <p><strong>Can you elaborate on what you miss about Japan?</strong>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>"I don’t know, everyone’s more willing to help each other in Japan, and more community-like, and tight. In the US, it seems like individuality is the biggest thing, so like, I care about me, you care about you, we care about each other, but I come first! Japan is more community-based, I help you, you help me, we are the biggest thing together, so I miss that part of it all."</p>

                                    <p><strong>What are some difficulties about studying in the US?</strong>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>"One thing I had to work on was to actually be open, and actually expressing my opinion. In Japan and Korea I was raised to be this little, nice, cute girl, who listened to their mom and dad, and not really rebel. But here, you’re free to voice your opinion, and I hadn’t really had the chance to do that back home. In classes, in the very first quarter, I was sitting there, not saying anything! I’m still working on it too, it’s a little hard for me, but that, I had to work on."</p>

                                    <p><strong>What do you enjoy about living and studying in the US?</strong>

So in my high school, in Japan, it was basically the rich people paying for that kind of education, and it was expensive. So like I was hanging out with a lot of diverse [people] nationally, but not socio-economically. But here, I get exposed to people from different socio-economic backgrounds as well, and I noticed how privileged I was. I was complaining back at home, ‘mom and dad, why can’t we go to Hawaii for break?’ But here, I’m like, ‘wow, there’s a lot of people who are suffering, and I am really privileged.’ So that kind of thing was very insightful. And other things in general, like US culture and food. Food is amazing. UChicago in general, I’d say I really like the life here. I feel like I’m home with those RSO’s I’m involved in. There’s some drawbacks, but in general, I think it’s really amazing."

                                <p><strong>Why did you decide to go to college in the US?</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>"At the time, most of the school in Canada, you had to choose your major right before you applied to college, so you had to choose from the get-go, and I wasn’t really sure I wanted to commit to something that early. So in a sense, it’s been a good experience for me here at UChicago, having a chance to try everything about, with the Core Curriculum and all that. It’s not something you really find in Canadian schools, that’s why I wanted to apply to an American school."</p>
                                <p><strong>How did you pick UChicago?</strong>
                                </p>
                                "It’s a funny story really—I only visited two universities, UChicago and Northwestern campus. I visited the UChicago campus first, and they gave me a campus tour—they had a woman walk around who was a third-year, I think, and she was really enthusiastic talking about the Core Curriculum and all the facilities here. I was like ‘oh, this is pretty cool!’ Then, right after, we went to Northwestern, and all we did was sit in a classroom and it was a monotonous, boring 2 hours. So just by comparison, UChicago looked really, really, attractive, so that’s why I applied here."</p>

                                <p><strong>What campus groups are you involved in?</strong>
                                </p>

                                <p>"I’ve always been interested in martial arts. I trained in Canada, but I didn’t really have time to do much of it until I came to University, so I started with the judo club and then I discovered Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I trained over the summer in Hong Kong and I just decided, ‘why not start my own RSO here?’ because there wasn’t one in existence—the American students flocked to it, they loved it. It’s a pretty big sport here, you know, MMA—that kind of combat sports are pretty good. I’ve got a nice gathering so far, and it’s helped me connect with the American students pretty well."</p>

                                <p><strong>What are your plans after graduation, both short-term and long-term?</strong>
                                </p>

                                <p>"Immediately after graduating, I’m planning on either working in Hong Kong or Canada, or I have this crazy idea of going to Thailand and training martial arts for a year—we’ll see how that goes in terms of job applications and stuff. But as for long-term, I think I’d rather settle in Canada, just because I grew up there, it’s my hometown, all my friends are there."</p>

                                <p><strong>What’s the story behind your US-Canada double-citizenship?</strong>
                                </p>

                                <p>"I was born in the States—hooray, birthright citizenship!—and then I went back to China for like the first three years of my life, and then I went to Toronto after, and I’ve stayed in Toronto for primary school, for middle school, for high school, and along the way I’ve picked up my Canadian citizenship."</p>

                                <p><strong>What’s the biggest difficulty about studying in America?</strong>
                                </p>

                                <p>"I don’t have a support system here. I really don’t, because my family is in Canada, and if something goes wrong, I’m in this country by myself. I’m actually the only American citizen in my family, because I’m a dual-citizen, I’m a Canadian and American dual-citizen, and it’s because I have the good fortune of being born in Flushing, New York. So my parents, they’re Canadian citizens, they work in Canada, and they’ve sent me here for school. Also, another thing—the exchange rate, I do not enjoy the exchange rate. Thanks to the oil price going down, the Canadian dollar has depreciated against the American dollar, and my tuition is going up. But, if I want to talk to my parents, I have to call them, I have to Skype them. If something gets difficult for me, I can’t, sort of, in a weekend, pack up, go home, mental health weekend, [and] come back all fresh to go. I have to sort of hammer it through myself."</p>

                                <p><strong>Why did you choose UChicago?</strong>
                                </p>

                                <p>"Part of why I wanted to come to Chicago was because there’s these great cultural organizations. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra is one of the great five orchestras in America, and the Lyric Opera is second to the Met, so it’s no New York, but it’s pretty, pretty good, and I’m a big fan of performance art, and I really wanted to come here because I wanted to see not just the University but also Chicago."</p>

                                <p><strong>What is your favorite thing about studying in the US, or at UChicago?</strong>
                                </p>

                                <p>"[Jokingly] I would have to say freedom. It’s a bit of a challenging question. Culturally, the US isn’t that different from Canada where I grew up, so it’s hard to pick a specific thing about the US that sort of appealed to me. But I would say, it’s all the people I’ve met. The thing is, it was only possible for me to meet the people I’ve met here, here, and not somewhere else. So that’s the thing I really enjoy, that I come into contact with all these peers, all these different ideas, with all these different points of views, whether or not I agree with them, but I’ve made some pretty nice friends, and I enjoy that."

                                </p>
                                <p>"It was kind of by chance. In my…first year of high school, I was invited by an agent to one of their lectures to promote their courses and their services. My parent and I went to that event, and I just thought ‘oh, this is cool,’ and by the time that I thought that, my English was good [enough] to support my study in the United States, so I tried to take one or two classes about the SAT, and thought that it was something I could manage…so I thought I was going to go abroad to the US to enjoy my college life. In the United States, there are many more top-tier schools, as compared to China. The other reason is that I thought that the academic rigor and freedom here is better than at universities in China. When I was in high school, I heard a lot of stories about how students, after getting in to a top-tier college in China, just stopped studying, and they really enjoyed their four years of college without studying very much. The situation is completely different in the United States. The academic rigor here is really very challenging."</p>
                                <p><strong>On the growth of Chinese international students at UChicago:</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>"On the China side, with the economy growing so fast, and especially in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, there are more people and more families in the category of "middle class." They are able to afford their students a better education in the United States. 10 years before, we’ve got a stereotype that people who, after attending high school in China, go to the United States, are people who could not get in to a very good college in China for gaokao [the Chinese college entrance exam], and they were escaping the gaokao. Now, the trend is that a lot of the ‘elite’ students from China are going to top-tier American universities. First of all, their families can afford that, and second, people are realizing that the quality of higher education in China is not quite satisfactory. Except for the top-tier schools in China…students’ lives are so laid-back and relaxed. They are not studying, and they cannot get much from their college experience. That’s why a lot of students are coming to the United States."</p>

                                </p>
                                <p>"I don’t want to say a language barrier—I think it’s more of a personality thing. What I feel here is that, for the language part, it is enough for us to take courses, to participate in discussions, but when it comes to small talk, it involves a lot of cultural background…when there is no specific topic we are talking about, I just don’t know how to find a topic, an interesting topic, to talk about with people. That’s a challenge for me to adjust socially in the United States, with the US style of socializing."</p>

The fact that you can just talk to professors, and talk to them and get to know them on a personal level, but at the same time have really interesting academic conversations; talk about their research, get mentorship, it’s sort of this thing that you don’t really get in really large schools. I actually did a year of college in Argentina, before I came here. So just to give you some contrast, people here complain about ‘Oh, I couldn’t get in to Psychology of Negotiation,’ but my cousin studies architecture at the University of Buenos Aires, and she had to get to class two hours earlier, because she wanted to sit, since she has a problem with her legs. If you want to sit, you have to get there two hours early, if you want to fit into the room, you have to get there one hour early, and if you don’t, you just miss lecture, because you can’t fit in to the room. That’s the kind of overcrowding we’re talking about. Of course, it’s a public education, it’s really good, it’s free, the professors are great, but at the same time, there’s a lot of people and the fact that we get to have small classes here, and that professors really have the time to care, is something I deeply, deeply, appreciate."</p>

                                <p>"I always like to tell this story….In Argentina, we have what’s called ‘ultra-pasteurized milk,’ which is milk that you don’t have to refrigerate if it’s not open. So you just go in the aisles, and there’s a lot of milk, and you just pick your carton, and you open it, and you put it in the fridge. But you don’t need to have it in the fridge all the time. I was really used to that, and I went to Treasure Island—I was trying to find milk that you didn’t need to put in the fridge. I asked this to the store clerk, and they looked at me with this face like, ‘What is wrong with you?!’ And, it’s stuff that sounds so stupid, but for me, it was like, ‘Wait, you mean I have to buy milk all the time?’ I really like milk, I consume a lot of milk, and right now, I have 15 cartons of milk, and I have a fridge that I just fill with milk….it sounds so stupid, but it’s stuff like that that people don’t really understand."</p>

                                <p>"I really like going to thrift stores. I think some things about this country are so ridiculous, like thrift stores, the prices, and the things you find there. ‘So you’re selling me Trivial Pursuit for 50 cents?! What is this?! I’ll take it!’ I think it’s so funny to walk around and find all this stuff…what I’ve learned here, and I think I was not as used to in Argentina since there’s not as much of it, is how much I love buying used stuff."</p>

                                <p><strong>Why did you pick UChicago?</strong>
                                </p>

                                <p>"I wanted to be in a city—that was one of my biggest priorities. I was born and raised in one, so I tried to have other people around me. Cities have always been attractive to me, so I mostly applied to schools in big cities. Chicago certainly fit that role here. Of course, the economics department is extremely good. I also looked at other things, like what if I reach there and don’t like economics, then I want to make sure it’s good at other things I might be interested in. I looked at the math department, and the physics department, and the statistics department. UChicago seemed to have a good combination of all of those. I looked at Career Advancement opportunities, so I looked at the kind of advisor they offered for postgraduation purposes, whether it’s for going into academia, or business, or going into journalism…In my research I did come across the UCIB program, how they partner with Booth, and how I would be allowed to take classes at Booth, so that was an integral part of the many reasons why UChicago was my top choice. It was way more practical than emotional."</p>

                                <p><strong>What do you like about studying at UChicago?</strong>
                                </p>

                                <p>"At the social level, I think the biggest change for me was the diversity—just meeting people over these four years from different countries, different backgrounds, different experiences. The kind of stuff I’ve gotten to know, I could just not have imagined. I think I’ve become a smarter person, just general-knowledge wise. If I were to sit at a table, I could talk about America, I could talk about European countries, and the culture that exists there, and the Middle East—I have friends from there. China, Singapore, Hong Kong, you can sit in your home country and read about all this, but it’s different when you talk to a person who’s had experiences in different countries. Even within the US, people from different states are so different!"</p>

                                <p><strong>In the long-term, do you see yourself staying in the US or going back to India?</strong>
                                </p>

                                <p>"I do not see myself settling down in India. I can kind of say that with a certain amount of surety, just because I want to get in to finance…for the kind of work I want to do, as a woman, India is not the best corporate environment for that. Especially for a woman—so I’m talking from a very female perspective—my parents are doctors, so I don’t have a business waiting for me to catch up with, or to inherit. I feel that things work on merit here, I feel more accomplished here, I feel my work is recognized more here, I feel safer here, as a woman. My parents accept that, too. In Delhi, there were times I felt unsafe. Those would be the reasons why I feel my work or occupation would lead me to India."</p>

                    Liu also noted that the University of Chicago’s recent rise in the U.S. News and World Report’s college rankings often influences the decision of Chinese students to attend the University.

                    Nikita Sachdeva, a fourth-year international student from India, indicated that the devaluation of Indian currency in recent years has made it more difficult for Indian students to study abroad. This may have contributed to the slight decrease in the percentage of international Indian students at UChicago.
                </p>
                <p class='text body-text'>
                    “If you look at what’s happened in the past one and a half years, Indian currency has devalued. When I started school, one USD was equal to around 50 Indian rupees. Now, one USD is equal to 62 Indian rupees. For any parent who’s paying a part of the tuition, or the full tuition, it’s a big change. It’s a big jump in how much you have to pay in four years. I don’t think it’s become any easier at the economic or financial level for the Indian student.”

                <p class='text body-text'>However, Sachdeva was quick to add that UChicago’s focus on India, exemplified by its new Center in New Delhi, has spurred interest from Indian students to study abroad at UChicago.
                </p>
                <p class='text body-text'>“I think UChicago is actually one of the bigger reasons why there’s been an influx of Indian students. UChicago has been pretty invested in India--now they have a center in Delhi, which they opened last year—which is a big deal. Not many other big schools—your Ivy Leagues, your Stanford, MIT, have done that yet,” she said. “I think looking at India from a different perspective, UChicago’s really got that going for them. They see Indian students as a boon for the University, maybe. Maybe they come here, do well, and at the end of the day it reflects pretty well on UChicago.”</p>
                <p class='text body-text'>Sachdeva also indicated that criticisms of the Indian system of education, which tends to focus on memorization and rote learning, have also driven interest in American education.
                </p>
                <p class='text body-text'>“I do think there is a growing urge among Indian students—especially in the big cities, Mumbai, Delhi—to step outside and just explore a new system of education which is very different from the Indian system of education. There is a lot of criticism of the Indian system of education,” she said. “It’s more based on the sciences, it’s more based on learning than understanding. In my high school...you could get by just by rote learning.”
