                        On April 29, 2024, the University of Chicago joined X
                        other universities across the nation in establishing an
                        encampment to support divestment from Israel. Students
                        argued that retracting all university investments in
                        weapons manufacturers and Israeli institutions was
                        imperative to stopping the war on Gaza and saving
                        Palestinian civilian livesCITE (QUOTE?). They erected
                        tents on part of the Quad, hosted daily events, and
                        refused to leave until they obtained a long-sought after
                        meeting with University President Paul Alivisatos.

                        Paul Alivisatos sent the following email to the student

                            I believe the protesters should also consider that
                            an encampment, with all the etymological connections
                            of the word to military origins, is a way of using
                            force of a kind rather than reason to persuade
                            others. For a short period of time, however, the
                            impact of a modest encampment does not differ so
                            much from a conventional rally or march.

                        Was Alivisatos correct that student activists had not
                        tried to reason? As a student of the undergraduate class
                        of '22, I had been relatively new to the idea of
                        divestment.

                        strategy central to pro-Palestine activism, which
                        posited that money constituted the most effective form
                        of non-violent protest. The quotes that introduced this

                    Beginning around 2013, the fossil fuel divestment movement
                    triggered the most significant divestment activism on campus
                    in decades. Related student organizations have steadily

                        Curtis Black, the article's author, was referring to the
                        protests outside the Continental Illinois Bank in 1967,
                        years before the word "divest" was used to describe such
                        movements. Students protesting the bank's holdings in
                        South Africa were summarily arrested. Little else was
                        heard on the topic until ten years later, when momentum
                        gathered at campuses across the country.

                    Historically, activists mainly used so-called non-coercive
                    tactics. 41% of actions recorded in the Maroon can be
                    categorized as letter-writing, including open letters,
                    opinion-editorials, letters to the editor, and petitions.
                    The Maroon itself has never shied away from issuing its own
                    opinions both for and against divestment.

                    In later years, students increasingly turned to protests

                    tactic; after all, the first recorded divestment action at
                    UChicago was a picket line.

                    UChicago, to Paul G. Alivisatos, the 13th president. Each

                        administration has agreed to give interviews with
                        student newspapers, publish opinion essays explaining
                        their stance, or present public forums organized by
                        student government. On a few occasions, campus groups
                        successfully gained an audience with the administration
                        to negotiate divestment directly.

                        In 1985, after 18 years of campus activism, President
                        Gray signed a partnership with South African
                        universities to increase opportunities for South African
                        students in America, as well as to conduct research into
                        social change in the country. In 2007, after nearly a

                        established a support fund of $200,000 earmarked for
                        research on Sudan. And in 2021, 8 years after the
                        formation of the first fossil fuel divestment-related

                    It is difficult to determine whether campus activism
                    directly caused successive administrations to take action on
                    these causes, or if the resulting actions were at all
                    effective in addressing the target problems.

                    Universities are peculiar environments, one of the only
                    communities with almost guaranteed 100% turnover every 4
                    years. Institutional knowledge is incredibly difficult to
                    retain, and sometimes it appears that the campus is
                    repeating history. And yet, this constant churn of ideas may
                    yet be a double-edged sword: universities are also
                    historically foci of social change.

                    The archives help illuminate the context and history of the
                    past year of divestment movements on campus, but they cannot
                    show us the future. The next 50 years could follow the same
                    endless cat-and-mouse game, or they could hold the key to
                    breaking out. As a campus community, we must take decisive
                    action one way or another: for divestment or against it.

                    This project focused on pro-divestment activism and the
                    administration's response. Student- or faculty-led
                    counter-activism events were not included due to project
                    scope. A pro-divestment activism event was defined as
                    follows: 1. all articles from the Maroon website or digitized
                    archives which contained the word "divest" from search results; 
                    2. had divestment as the main subject, excluding meta-commentary 
                    on effective strategies for divestment activism or histories of 
                    divestment activism; 3. defined divestment as withdrawing current
                    investments, not declining to renew contracts, or other related topics;
                    4. could be defined as a discrete instance, whether as a news event or 
                    a publication, excluding duplicate coverage of the same event; 5.
                    were located on UChicago campus or involved UChicago students, excluding 
                    reporting about other schools or Chicago city politics.
