                        Conflicting priorities, land use disputes, and racial
                        tension have driven the University of Chicago’s physical
                        expansion and the evolution of a historically fraught
                        “town and gown” relationship with Hyde Park and the
                        surrounding neighborhoods. The University was the first
                        higher education institution to embark on an urban
                        renewal campaign of its kind, setting the stage for
                        others to follow, a topic scholars and students have
                        written on extensively.
