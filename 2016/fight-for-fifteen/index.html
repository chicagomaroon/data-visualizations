                        On April 15, a group of UChicago students from groups
                        such as Students Organizing United with Labor (SOUL),
                        South Side Solidarity Network (SSN), and IIRON Students
                        Network (ISN) joined fast food and retail workers in
                        downtown Chicago at a “Fight for $15” rally. The group
                        marched to demand an increase in Chicago’s minimum wage
                        to $15 per hour.

                        Fight for $15, as the national movement is called, is
                        not just a hot-button issue on campus. Similar rallies
                        took place across the country. This movement comes in
                        light of increases to the minimum wage to $15 per hour
                        in Seattle last June and more recently in Los Angeles.

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        While much of the talk surrounding the minimum wage
                        issue at these rallies and in the media involves
                        McDonald’s and other large corporations, small
                        businesses are heavily affected by proposed wage
                        increases. While many small business managers in Hyde
                        Park and Woodlawn support the concept of minimum wage
                        increases, several are concerned with the effects on
                        their businesses and the changes that they would have to
                        make should Chicago’s minimum wage increase to $15 an
                        hour.

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        These managers are already dealing with recent wage
                        increases in Chicago: Last December the city council
                        voted to raise the Chicago’s minimum wage to $13 per
                        hour. This will be put into effect incrementally,
                        increasing from the current $8.25 to $10 per hour by
                        July, with the increase to $13 by 2019.

                        Local managers will respond to current and potential
                        future wage increases by making significant changes in
                        their stores, either affecting their employees or their
                        customers.

                        Trushar Patel—manager of Rajun Cajun, an Indian
                        restaurant—currently pays his eight employees within a
                        $10–$12 per hour range. He explains that he would raise
                        costs of his food, but would not change management
                        practices. “You can’t change the hours because Indian
                        restaurants require a lot of preparation,” he said. “I
                        wouldn’t look for different employees because they
                        already need to be skilled, so we would have to raise
                        our food’s prices.”

                        Other managers worry that the size of their stores will
                        be a hindrance if such changes are to take effect. “As
                        an independent business like mine we are going to be
                        walking a thin line,” said Bader El-Shareif, owner of
                        Harper Foods. El-Shareif currently employs only one
                        person, and pays him more than $10 per hour, yet he’s
                        concerned that if the minimum wage is increased to $15
                        per hour, “we already can’t compete with other stores,
                        because they’re so big. We’ll just have to eat the extra
                        cost.”

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Opponents of increasing the minimum wage to $15 argue
                        that while it may benefit those able to obtain the
                        higher pay, it increases unemployment for less skilled
                        workers.

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Allen Sanderson, a senior lecturer in economics who has
                        publicly opposed minimum wage increases, says that large
                        corporations are more likely to automate in the face of
                        minimum wage increases, replacing workers with machines
                        and thus increasing unemployment. He says that the
                        concern is similar in small businesses: “unskilled
                        workers are going to be replaced by people like
                        University of Chicago anthropology students looking for
                        part-time or entry-level work with a higher skill

                        Alexis Bouteville, manager of Hyde Park Records,
                        confirmed this assessment in the case of his store,
                        which employs three full-time employees and pays more
                        than the current minimum wage but less than $15. “If the
                        minimum wage were $15, I would certainly consider higher
                        standards for hiring,” he said. “I wouldn’t change the
                        way the business itself works,” he said of raising
                        prices on the store’s items. “But in terms of
                        management, I would cut employees’ hours and try to get
                        the best deal on who I hired.”

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Activists involved in the Fight for $15 disagree with
                        predictions of negative economic effects. Second-year
                        Psalm Brown, head of SOUL, argues that “while it’s
                        always economists’ concern that once you raise the cost
                        of labor fewer people are employed, that’s not the case.
                        In places with significant wage increases there hasn’t
                        been a corresponding drop in people employed.” Some past
                        studies support this, such as a 1990 UC Berkeley study
                        on fast food chains before and after minimum wage
                        increases, which found that effects on unemployment are
                        minimal.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Calculations based on the current number of minimum wage
                        workers in Chicago and the number of those marginally
                        below the poverty line indicate that the most recent
                        increase will affect 410,000 minimum wage workers and
                        pull 70,000 out of poverty, according to the Chicago
                        Tribune. Yet Brown and other organizers argue that it’s
                        not enough. Brianna Tong (A.B. ’15), head of ISN, said,
                        “I think it’s messed up that people make what they do
                        working full time and are still in poverty, not having
                        enough to feed themselves and their kids.”

                        Local business managers and employees support raising
                        the minimum wage in principle, arguing as Tong does that
                        current wages are not high enough, but out of concern
                        for their businesses, and because they aren’t sure what
                        the effects will be, they support alternatives to
                        raising the minimum wage.

                        Dylan Harris, who graduated from UChicago last year and
                        now works full-time at Hyde Park Records, earns $14 an
                        hour. He said that although “I can live pretty
                        comfortably on what I’m making right now…if I have even
                        a [single] kid it wouldn’t be enough at all. I think the
                        minimum wage is way too low.” Still, he agreed with his
                        manager that “for small businesses like these, it would
                        be a tight squeeze…. Maybe we could have a lower minimum
                        wage for someone younger without a lot of
                        dependence…more of a need-based system.” El-Sharief from
                        Harper Foods agreed that “we all know that you can’t
                        live on $9 or even $11 an hour if you have a family, but
                        you know, that’s the system. It cannot go unbalanced.”

                        Still, some local business managers are not too
                        concerned about the wage increase. In fact, in some
                        cases, the smaller sizes of these stores may help. Chris
                        Willard, a manager at Blackstone Bicycle Works in
                        Woodlawn, explained that most minimum wage increases,
                        even to $15 per hour, would not be drastically harmful.
                        “We only have five employees,” he says, “so while an
                        increase to $15 might change things, I don’t think it
                        would put us out of business.”

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        The incremental increases will make the transition to
                        $13 an hour easier as well, and many hope a potential
                        increase to $15 would come about the same way. “We’re
                        going to have to sit down and crunch some numbers to
                        offset cost if it happens but if it’s incremental it
                        will be much easier to absorb,” explained Chris Salmon,
                        a manager at Powell’s independent bookstore, who pays
                        most of the store’s eight employees the current minimum
                        wage. “If it’s going to go up slowly each year there
                        probably won’t be a lot of major changes at the store,”
                        he said.
