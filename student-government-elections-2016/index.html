I [Jones] am on the organizing committee for the GSU, Grad Students United. Our main concerns are this: we are interested in improving how we’re paid, improving healthcare for every graduate student, we like to improve support for how families are treated under healthcare, spouses are treated under health care, as well as abolishing the hours cap for graduate labor, the 19 hours cap per week because it actually hurts, for instance, not-fully-funded masters students when they are trying to pay for their own education...

I think that I’ve tried to make it something that sounded feasible.... Having a clear channel for all student groups to meet with the board, not just the loudest, should they have a need, is something that’s really important to me.... The centering principle of my platform is greater transparency and understanding for the student body about what the board of trustees is and what it does and what the channels are for students to actually access the board.”</p>

Also, the campaign Fair Budget UChicago has been asking to meet with the board for some time and has accrued significant student support on campus to the point that they are warranted at least some time to discuss. The [U of C Divest] has certainly riled up campus, but given the CC resolution and the student petition, I think they’ve merited themselves time to present their case to the board....

I think there are a lot of issues, especially right now, that affect different graduate divisions very differently, so for me a key part of my platform is understanding those differences and understanding how to bring those perspectives to the Board of Trustees. I think secondly it would be somewhat of a customized experience.... So I think understanding what issues we can come together as a graduate community on and what issues really should be decided on more locally within each division, can be decided more locally for absence of a better term within each division, and how to present those issues in a unified but distinctive way to the Board of Trustees. The third part would be unified progress. Student activism is a wonderful thing, especially on this campus—it’s a strong culture on this campus, but there are other stakeholders that need to be engaged in producing change.”</p>
