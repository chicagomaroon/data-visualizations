                        community and student group demands have been framed in
                        opposition to the University of Chicago Medical Center

                        different question on which consensus has not been
                        reached: whether a trauma center will actually improve
                        trauma mortality outcomes. The establishment of a trauma
                        center at UCMC is one of several solutions to trauma
                        mortality that are currently under consideration. What

                    <p class="text body-text first-paragraph">
                        On August 15th, 2010, youth advocate and aspiring
                        musician Damian Turner was gunned down in a drive-by
                        shooting, only four blocks from UCMC. Chicago Fire
                        Department paramedics were required to drive him to the
                        nearest Level 1 trauma center, Northwestern Memorial
                        Hospital, on the northern edge of downtown. Some claim
                        that if the South Side, through UCMC, had been equipped
                        with a T1, Turner would still be alive today.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        The first hour after the onset of out-of-hospital
                        traumatic injury is typically referred to as the “golden
                        hour,” and is considered a crucial, life-or-death window
                        of time when trauma can be safely addressed. Yet the
                        relationship between transit-to-hospital time and
                        mortality outcomes remains largely unclear. In March of
                        2010, a nationwide study conducted by Dr. Newgard, who
                        is the Director of the Center for Policy and Research in
                        Emergency Medicine at Oregon Health &amp; Science
                        University, analyzed 3,656 trauma patients, ages 15 and
                        up, and found that there was no association between
                        transport time and in-hospital mortality. Furthermore,
                        total emergency medical services (EMS) time, which
                        includes activation of EMS, time-to-scene, and transport
                        time still did not predict in-hospital death.

                        under penetrating trauma. Utilizing a database of 19,167
                        trauma patients, they found that trauma severity and the
                        time a patient is at the scene of injury strongly
                        predicted penetrating trauma mortality: patients who
                        were at the scene longer and sustained harsher injuries
                        were more likely to die. However, transport times did

                        restricting their study to 11,744 GSW patients, her team
                        found that when victims were shot more than 5 miles from
                        Level I or II trauma centers, this corresponded with a
                        higher likelihood of mortality.

                        trauma centers was found to have some positive effect on
                        survival outcomes for gunshot wound (GSW) victims,
                        injury severity, lack of insurance and suicide intent
                        were overwhelmingly more predictive of mortality. IDPH
                        concluded that reducing mortality due to GSWs will
                        require a strategy that, not only improves trauma care
                        access, but also fosters mental health service access
                        and addresses the disparity of health insurance. In
                        their own discussion of the study’s results, Crandall et
                        al noted that “modifications of trauma systems cannot
                        address any of these issues.”

                        The Illinois Department of Public Health released the
                        “Trauma Center Feasibility Study” this past January,
                        which assessed the level of services currently available
                        at various hospitals within the City of Chicago, and
                        surveyed each responding facility about its interest in
                        pursuing a trauma level designation. Trauma levels are
                        traditionally designated on a level of 1 to 5, from
                        offering most comprehensive to least comprehensive care,
                        though only levels 1 through 3 were considered for this
                        survey in light of the need to address penetrating

                        Using a feasibility cutoff of 60%, indicating that the
                        facility in question already has 60% of available
                        resources to sustain a particular trauma center level,
                        IDPH found that UCMC was the only respondent that could

                        sustain a Level 2 center. Yet when surveyed for its
                        interest in acquiring a trauma level designation, UCMC
                        indicated no interest despite having the highest
                        readiness. Advocate Trinity, Jackson Park and Roseland,
                        however, expressed high interest in acquiring a trauma
                        level designation despite their poorer feasibility

                        When asked whether they would be willing to help finance
                        a T1 at another South Side hospital, UCMC stated via
                        e-mail that, over the past few years, they have met with
                        other area health care providers and medical directors
                        about ways to improve South Side health care. Among
                        them, trauma care and violence prevention were
                        repeatedly discussed. “Trauma services overwhelmed the
                        hospital’s other surgical facilities and delayed
                        life-saving procedures for other patients,” stated the
                        UCMC in an email. UCMC also mentioned that that, even
                        today, operating rooms are often fully occupied for
                        life-saving and advanced surgeries, many of which are
                        not available at other hospitals in the area.

                        to tackle trauma in the South Side, while maintaining
                        other vital services. It stated that they “remain open
                        to working with state, city, county and other healthcare
                        providers to evaluate the needs of the South Side and
                        the long-term financial and operational realities of
                        running an adult trauma center,” encouraging a regional
                        solution. A feasibility study, which began this past
                        January, by UCMC will assess the realities of opening a
                        trauma center on the South Side.

                        This statement followed a number of expansions by the
                        hospital, including the expansion of the age of
                        non-trauma patients in Comer Children’s Hospital’s
                        pediatric emergency department from 15 to 17 years of
                        age last summer. Most recently, UCMC announced that it
                        is taking formal steps toward raising the age limit of
                        Comer’s Level 1 pediatric trauma center from 15 to 17
                        years of age. Last year, Comer T1 cared for 260
                        children. According to UCMC, Comer Children’s Hospital
                        will care for about 120 more patients as a result of the
                        age increase, which would be about a 40% increase in its
                        number of patients.

                        Veronica Morris Moore, youth organizer for Fearless
                        Leading by the Youth emphasized that while T1 has
                        acquired substantial press coverage, it isn’t the only
                        possibility for addressing trauma care on the South
                        Side. “It doesn’t have to be a level 1 trauma center at
                        the University of Chicago,” Moore said. “They open up a
                        level 2? Somewhere else? I’m not going to be mad at
                        that,” she said. “I’m not going to keep protesting for a
                        level I. We’re not unreasonable people.”

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Moore also emphasized at UCMC should not be the only
                        provider of trauma care in the South Side, either. “I
                        believe there needs to be a network. So we can’t just be
                        on the shoulders of the University. It has to be a
                        support team…different levels, different agencies have
                        to be a part of this,” she said. She insisted that there
                        should be a joint meeting in which Aldermen of South
                        Side neighborhoods, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, President
                        O’Keefe, other heads of healthcare providers within the
                        region, community members and youth leaders congregate

                        corroborated Moore’s assessment that more frequent,
                        inclusive communication is needed moving forward. He
                        believes that tactics used by community and student
                        groups to approach the administration were not
                        well-received, and cites miscommunication as the cause
                        for slow progress. “It works both ways. Things that the
                        hospital administration was saying weren’t well
                        understood, or taken as seriously, by community and
                        student groups,” Pratt said.

                        challenge that will require considerable efforts to
                        surmount, given the South Side’s financial obstacles.
                        “No less than six hospitals in the south side have
                        disappeared…and the University of Chicago is one of a
                        handful of hospitals that has remained in existence”

                        care providers in the South Side.

                        Existing hospitals had to become either secondary care
                        institutions, which provided basic in-patient care, or
                        academic tertiary care centers, such as UCMC. The latter
                        types rely on their reputation to bring in patients with
                        more robust forms of insurance that allow patients to
                        cover the full costs of their care and subsidize the
                        care of patients in the south side.

                        at the cost of vital services which address chronic
                        illnesses the University already struggles to provide,
