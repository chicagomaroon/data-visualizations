            Report of a faculty committee, under the chairmanship of Harry
            Kalven, Jr. Committee appointed by President George W. Beadle.
            Report published in the Record, Vol. I, No. 1, November 11, 1967.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Committee was appointed in February 1967 by President George W.
            Beadle and requested to prepare “a statement on the University’s
            role in political and social action.” The Committee conceives its
            function as principally that of providing a point of departure for
            discussion in theUniversity community of this important question.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Committee has reviewed the experience of the University in such
            matters as its participation in neighborhood redevelopment, its
            defense of academic freedom in the Broyles Bill inquiry of the 1940s
            and again in the Jenner Committee hearings of the early 1950s, its
            opposition to the Disclaimer Affidavit in the National Defense
            Education Act of 1958, its reappraisal of the criteria by which it
            rents the off-campus housing it owns, and its position on furnishing
            the rank of male students to Selective Service. In its own
            discussions, the Committee has found a deep consensus on the
            appropriate role of the university in political and social action.
            It senses some popular misconceptions about that role and wishes,
            therefore, simply to reaffirm a few old truths and a cherished
            tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
            A university has a great and unique role to play in fostering the
            development of social and political values in a society. The role is
            defined by the distinctive mission of the university and defined too
            by the distinctive characteristics of the university as a community.
            It is a role for the long term.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mission of the university is the discovery, improvement, and
            dissemination of knowledge. Its domain of inquiry and scrutiny
            includes all aspects and all values of society. A university
            faithful to its mission will provide enduring challenges to social
            values, policies, practices, and institutions. By design and by
            effect, it is the institution which creates discontent with the
            existing social arrangements and proposes new ones. In brief, a good
            university, like Socrates, will be upsetting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The instrument of dissent and criticism is the individual faculty
            member or the individual student. The university is the home and
            sponsor of critics; it is not itself the critic. It is, to go back
            once again to the classic phrase, a community of scholars. To
            perform its mission in the society, a university must sustain an
            extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an
            independence from political fashions, passions, and pressures. A
            university, if it is to be true to its faith in intellectual
            inquiry, must embrace, be hospitable to, and encourage the widest
            diversity of views within its own community. It is a community but
            only for the limited, albeit great, purposes of teaching and
            research. It is not a club, it is not a trade association, it is not
            a lobby.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the university is a community only for these limited and
            distinctive purposes, it is a community which cannot take collective
            action on the issues of the day without endangering the conditions
            for its existence and effectiveness. There is no mechanism by which
            it can reach a collective position without inhibiting that full
            freedom of dissent on which it thrives. It cannot insist that all of
            its members favor a given view of social policy; if it takes
            collective action, therefore, it does so at the price of censuring
            any minority who do not agree with the view adopted. In brief, it is
            a community which cannot resort to majority vote to reach positions
            on public issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            The neutrality of the university as an institution arises then not
            from a lack of courage nor out of indifference and insensitivity. It
            arises out of respect for free inquiry and the obligation to cherish
            a diversity of viewpoints. And this neutrality as an institution has
            its complement in the fullest freedom for its faculty and students
            as individuals to participate in political action and social
            protest. It finds its complement, too, in the obligation of the
            university to provide a forum for the most searching and candid
            discussion of public issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, the sources of power of a great university should not be
            misconceived. Its prestige and influence are based on integrity and
            intellectual competence; they are not based on the circumstance that
            it may be wealthy, may have political contacts, and may have
            influential friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            From time to time instances will arise in which the society, or
            segments of it, threaten the very mission of the university and its
            values of free inquiry. In such a crisis, it becomes the obligation
            of the university as an institution to oppose such measures and
            actively to defend its interests and its values. There is another
            context in which questions as to the appropriate role of the
            university may possibly arise, situations involving university
            ownership of property, its receipt of funds, its awarding of honors,
            its membership in other organizations. Here, of necessity, the
            university, however it acts, must act as an institution in its
            corporate capacity. In the exceptional instance, these corporate
            activities of the university may appear so incompatible with
            paramount social values as to require careful assessment of the
            consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
            These extraordinary instances apart, there emerges, as we see it, a
            heavy presumption against the university taking collective action or
            expressing opinions on the political and social issues of the day,
            or modifying its corporate activities to foster social or political
            values, however compelling and appealing they may be.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are admittedly matters of large principle, and the application
            of principle to an individual case will not be easy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our basic conviction is that a great university can perform greatly
            for the betterment of society. It should not, therefore, permit
            itself to be diverted from its mission into playing the role of a
            second-rate political force or influence.

        <p><i>Special Comment by Mr. Stigler:</i></p>
        <p>
            I agree with the report as drafted, except for the statements in the
            fifth paragraph from the end as to the role of the university when
            it is acting in its corporate capacity. As to this matter, I would
            prefer the statement in the following form:
        </p>
        <p>
            The university when it acts in its corporate capacity as employer
            and property owner should, of course, conduct its affairs with
            honor. The university should not use these corporate activities to
            foster any moral or political values because such use of its
            facilities will impair its integrity as the home of intellectual
            freedom.
