                When the University of Chicago was founded in 1890, it was
                envisioned as six quadrangles, each surrounded by buildings,
                bordering one larger quadrangle built on 22 acres of land.

                Today, the University has owned or managed over 200 properties
                and buildings in Hyde Park and the surrounding neighborhoods,
                spanning from 65th Street in the south, 38th Street in the
                north, Lake Michigan in the east, and I-90 to the west.

                        How did the University come to own its current property?
                        How have the boundaries of campus changed over time? As
                        conflicting priorities, land use disputes, and racial
                        issues have driven its physical expansion and the
                        evolution of a historically fraught “town and gown”
                        relationship, UChicago has had an active role in shaping
                        Hyde Park and the surrounding communities.

                        This interactive map documents UChicago’s property
                        acquisition from its 1890 charter to the present. The
                        accompanying narration is not an exhaustive history but
                        traces the contours of shifting university objectives.

                <p>
                    The data for this project was sourced from the University of
                    Chicago’s property records, which are available online. The
                    property records were then geocoded and visualized using the
                    Mapbox GL JS library. The timeline was created using the
                    Waypoints library. The project was built using HTML, CSS,
                    and JavaScript.
