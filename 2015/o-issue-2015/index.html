                                        discoveries and academic innovation.

                                The history of the University of Chicago is
                                relatively short for an elite research
                                institution, but the University’s history is

                                innovation. While you’ve no doubt heard of
                                achievements like the first sustained nuclear
                                reaction and the high number of Nobel
                                prize-winning economists, what’s truly
                                astounding is how the University has equaled
                                other institutions’ accomplishments and prestige
                                in a fraction of the time.

                                The University is celebrating its 125th
                                anniversary this year, through its origins date
                                back even further. In light of this anniversary
                                the idiom “know your past so that you may build
                                your future” is perhaps more applicable to this
                                university than any other. Why? In contrast to
                                peer institutions, which were founded as either
                                entirely secular public land grant colleges or
                                predominantly religious private seminaries, our
                                university was founded as a German research
                                institution with Baptist oil money. That meant
                                religious funds for secular scholarship; a
                                revolutionary concept. This, coupled with the
                                many great minds that have passed through our
                                grey citadel, has led to a history of ferocious
                                debate about what a preeminent Midwestern
                                institution should look like.

                                Dean of the College John W. Boyer, in his newly

                                <em>The University of Chicago: A History</em>,
                                breaks the history of the University’s

                                history of the student body can perhaps be
                                divided into five epochs—five distinct phases in
                                which the culture of the University’s campus has
                                adopted a specific tone. What has remained
                                constant across all of these periods for the
                                student body is, perhaps unsurprisingly, its
                                intense academicism.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text">
                                So let’s start in the beginning. The first epoch
                                was one of pure, hardcore academics at the “Old”
                                University of Chicago. In 1857 Stephen A.
                                Douglas, of Lincoln–Douglas debate fame, founded
                                an institution called University of Chicago in
                                what is now Brownsville. He created it as a
                                Baptist institution to honor his dead wife. In
                                this era a competitive intellectual culture was
                                nothing short of rampant. Social life revolved
                                around student oratorical contests. These
                                contests were notoriously cutthroat, with one
                                disgruntled senior going so far as to hold a
                                trustee member at gunpoint for not giving him
                                first place. Notwithstanding the vitality of
                                these oratorical contests, the university could
                                not keep itself afloat and shuttered its doors
                                in 1886.

                                In 1890, after much petitioning on the part of
                                university trustees Thomas Goodspeed and
                                Fredrick Gates, John D. Rockefeller donated the
                                funds to create the new University of Chicago.
                                The president was visionary William Rainey
                                Harper, a serious scholar of the classical and
                                semitic languages, who came to the University
                                from a Baptist seminary by way of Yale. Although
                                Rockefeller and others were determined to make
                                this university a Baptist one, Harper decided to
                                take a different route—following “the German
                                model.” Historically, a German research
                                institution is a place where knowledge is
                                pursued for its own sake <em>and</em> where
                                those pursuing it have the <em>freedom</em> to

                                And thus we enter the second epoch of the
                                University: the school spirit days.
                                Notwithstanding Harper’s sobriety, he allowed
                                and even encouraged social organizations like
                                fraternities and sports teams to set up shop on
                                campus. Harper went so far as to hope that if
                                his son did join a Greek organization, that it
                                would be “the Alpha Delts" (Bar Night has never
                                meant so much). He also was a large supporter of
                                the University’s football program, and became,
                                in Robert Lester’s words, an “evangelist of the
                                gridiron gospel.” He defended the coach, Amos
                                Alonzo Stagg, from faculty members who wanted to
                                see their students hitting the books instead of
                                each other. The University of Chicago’s
                                athleticism peaked long after Harper’s tenure
                                came to a close, in 1935 when Jay Berwanger won
                                the first Heismann Trophy.

                                Six years before this momentous occasion,
                                however, the young Robert Maynard Hutchins was
                                elected president of the University. At this
                                point, we see the University enter its most
                                radical phase. Almost immediately after Hutchins
                                came into office he started making changes. He
                                reorganized the University into four research
                                divisions plus a college of liberal arts. He
                                then implemented the “New Plan,” which would
                                provide general education for all students and
                                eliminate grades. (The New Plan evolved into our
                                Core, but unfortunately the grades are back.)

                                At the same time students became more
                                ideologically left, inviting members of the
                                Communist Party to speak on campus. Amos Alonzo
                                Stagg also agreed to allow a socialist-sponsored
                                Counter Olympics—the International Workers
                                Athletic Meet—to be staged on the field bearing
                                his name. Hutchins was compelled to defend both
                                the students and Stagg from the attacks of angry
                                alumni. In the late ’40s, Hutchins’ radical
                                nature and his defense of the radicals on his
                                campus set in motion an era of radicalism that
                                lasted until the late ’60s. The most notable
                                alumni of this era are famed organizing theorist
                                Saul D. Alinsky and presidential candidate
                                Bernie Sanders.

                                The next era is characterized by an intense, if
                                not Spartan, emphasis on academics.
                                Symbolically, this era is recognized by the
                                building of the Regenstein Library on top of
                                what was once Stagg Field. This was UChicago in
                                the ’80s. People came to school here then
                                because they really wanted to learn things. The
                                depressed attitude that characterized this
                                period at the school left alumni saying that
                                although they received a first-rate education,
                                they wouldn’t want to send their children here.
                                Then College President Donald Levine responded
                                to this by instituting now long-time University
                                traditions like Kuvia and parents visiting
                                weekend in the fall.

                                Fast-forward a few more years and we are where
                                we are at now. Dorm-building has resumed and
                                satellite dorms are shuttered to center
                                undergraduates on campus. The University is
                                becoming increasingly preprofessional with an
                                emphasis on expanding post-graduation
                                opportunities for students. A new relationship
                                with the city has allowed the University to
                                launch large-scale projects in the surrounding
                                neighborhoods. It’s an exciting time to be a
                                UChicago student.

                                            small talk isn’t always their forte.

                                            to new people. Even if it takes a

                                            just as eager to talk to you.

                                            their children to UChicago. Some of
                                            the most famous slogans are “Where
                                            fun goes to die,” “Hell does freeze
                                            over,” and “Where the only thing
                                            that goes down on you is your GPA.”
                                            But, as you’ll hear again and again,
                                            don’t take them seriously; the only
                                            thing the slogans reflect is the wit
                                            of the student body.

                                Center Coalition—which includes both student and
                                community activists—led a series of protests for
                                the University to build an adult Level 1 trauma
                                center on the South Side. The protests included
                                nine protesters barricading themselves in Levi
                                Hall, the University’s administrative building.
                                After police and firefighters broke through the
                                wall of the building, the nine protesters were
                                arrested. Another protest, which involved
                                disrupting an alumni awards ceremony, ended with
                                an alum assaulting some of the protestors and
                                being arrested by the University police.
                                Protests for a South Side trauma center have
                                escalated over the past few years at the

                                which protested the closure of the dorms,
                                changing of house names, and lack of student
                                involvement or input in the decision. The
                                closure of these dorms follows the more sudden
                                announcement and closure of Pierce dorm in 2013.

                                This past year, United Progress negotiated a

                                U-Pass program for the 2016–2017 school year.
                                UChicago voted in favor of the program
                                (undergraduates were split 55.1 percent for and
                                44.9 percent against), which will raise tuition
                                by $85 and allow full-time students access to

                                made significant changes to its transparency

                                Harris School offers nine different Master’s
                                degree programs and six different joint degree
                                programs, including the A.B./M.P.P. program.
                                This allows students to earn a Bachelor’s degree
                                from the College and a Master’s in Public Policy
                                from Harris in five years instead of six.
                                Through the Harris School, undergrads can also

                                and then return to Harris to complete their
                                degree. Students in the College can also submit
                                the Professional School Petition Form if they

                                rather than relocated, and North Campus will
                                consist of entirely new houses. While the
                                decision has been controversial and student

                                            with a shared bathroom and
                                            kitchenette) and adjoining single
                                            suites (two rooms with just a shared
                                            bathroom). Once only home to
                                            upperclassmen, the building is
                                            welcoming first-years for the last
                                            time this fall, for a total of
                                            approximately 80 residents. The
                                            building has plenty of community
                                            space to make up for the seclusion
                                            of a single room: There’s a lounge
                                            with a fireplace and grand piano,
                                            another with a TV, a computer lab
                                            and study space, and a community
                                            kitchen. The catch: Blackstone is
                                            about a 10-minute walk from campus.
                                            But it’s close to the 57th Street
                                            restaurants and shops, as well as
                                            the #6 bus or Metra to get downtown
                                            and away from the campus ruckus—it
                                            allows residents to find a happy
                                            medium between apartment and dorm
                                            life.

                                            Service Administration. The building
                                            holds just one
                                            house—Breckinridge—and consists of
                                            single and double rooms divided into
                                            single-sex floors for a total of
                                            about 95 residents. The lounge has
                                            ample socializing space and a grand
                                            piano, and the basement has a
                                            community kitchen and ping-pong and
                                            pool tables. The building sits on
                                            the north side of the Midway, giving
                                            residents easy access to open
                                            outdoor space for recreation. Like
                                            other satellite dorms, the comfort,
                                            space, and smaller tight-knit
                                            communities come at the cost of a
                                            distance from campus—Breck is about
                                            a 10-minute walk from the quad. On
                                            the other hand, it’s also right next
                                            to the 59th Street Metra station,
                                            making it easy to head downtown.

                                            dorm, a full 15-minute walk from the
                                            quad. (Don’t worry, there’s the #171
                                            bus and the shuttle system to get
                                            you back and forth.) The first floor
                                            has a computer lab, a library, a
                                            ballroom complete with a grand piano

                                            are divided into the three houses:
                                            Palmer, Wick, and Talbot. Each house
                                            is made of two floors of single,
                                            double, and one or two triple rooms,
                                            each with their own private
                                            bathroom, as well as a house lounge
                                            where students can do homework,
                                            watch TV, and play video games in a
                                            common space. The building’s on the
                                            older side, but it’s in the perfect
                                            spot to get downtown on the #6, #28,
                                            or #55 bus—and certain times of the
                                            year, the #10, running express to
                                            Water Tower Place—as well as being
                                            close to the lakefront, where
                                            students gather for Frisbee and
                                            cookouts when the weather’s good.

                                            mostly single rooms with common hall
                                            bathrooms. There’s a big communal

                                            maybe no one knows about Maclean
                                            because the residents are just too
                                            comfy to leave. Maclean is
                                            surrounded by private residences and
                                            has a spacious yard—it captures the

                                            bathrooms, and there’s a swanky
                                            atrium, study rooms, and an exercise
                                            room. It’s probably best situated
                                            for getting to graduate student
                                            buildings, but it’s also close to
                                            Cathey (South) Dining Hall and not
                                            far from the quad, either. For a
                                            satellite, it’s in a pretty good
                                            spot.

                                            In this neo-Gothic, castle-like
                                            building, 300 residents comprising
                                            six small houses live in mostly

                                            it does have two lounges (complete

                                            dorm—it’s home to 430 residents, but
                                            only 250 of those are UChicago
                                            undergraduates living in four
                                            houses. The rest are students from
                                            around the world—hence the
                                            name—studying at different
                                            institutions in Chicago. I-House is
                                            also a cultural center that hosts
                                            events and world-renowned speakers
                                            frequently. Because of this, I-House
                                            residents can enjoy a huge kitchen,
                                            a courtyard, and a lot of lounge
                                            space on the first floor. Each house
                                            has its own smaller lounge as well,
                                            and residents live in mostly single
                                            and a few double rooms. I-House
                                            isn’t exactly on campus, but it’s
                                            close, and there are plenty of
                                            positives to offset the distance.

                                            subtlety it makes up for with one of
                                            the best locations and a classic
                                            #collegelife feel. Max is next door
                                            to Bartlett Dining Hall and the Reg,
                                            and it’s the closest dorm to both
                                            Ratner Athletic Center and Henry
                                            Crown Field House, which makes it
                                            the perfect dorm for student
                                            athletes. Max definitely has a
                                            reputation as a kind of haven for
                                            those who aren’t feeling that whole
                                            “UChicago quirky” thing—it has a
                                            more “normal” and sporty vibe. To
                                            each his own. Max has three wings,
                                            East, Central, and West, connected
                                            by underground tunnels that hold
                                            laundry rooms, music rooms, and
                                            storage space. There are large
                                            lounge areas for the entire building
                                            and study spaces for each house.
                                            About 700 students divided into
                                            eight houses live in apartment style
                                            suites with two bedrooms (each with
                                            two beds), a bathroom, and a foyer
                                            area. You can decide whether sharing
                                            a bathroom with three is any better
                                            than sharing a bathroom with an
                                            entire floor. About one-fourth of
                                            the rooms are singles typically
                                            reserved for upperclassmen—but
                                            you’ll have something to aspire to.

                                            this dorm? The truth is it’s usually
                                            the early admits who put in their
                                            housing applications as soon as they
                                            could, but sometimes it seems more

                                            Snell-Hitchcock is made of Snell and
                                            Hitchcock houses, which hold about
                                            160 residents total, well-known for
                                            being the most quintessentially
                                            UChicago students on campus. Often
                                            referred to as “Snitchcock,” this
                                            dorm is actually on the main quad.
                                            Snell has only single rooms, and
                                            Hitchcock has a mix of singles and
                                            doubles. Each house has its own
                                            kitchen and laundry room, but they
                                            share a recreational room with
                                            ping-pong and pool tables. If you
                                            can deal with the overwhelming
                                            enthusiasm for every UChicago
                                            tradition, there is really no better

                                            Stony Island is less central and

                                            and a living room. It has reliable

                                            comfortably here, complaining only

                                            because it has a fully functional

                                do the same.

                                There are going to be times when your roommate
                                just needs space. Maybe it’s a spontaneous
                                hookup (Yes, sexile does happen at UChicago).
                                Maybe it’s a phone argument with a long-distance
                                significant other that keeps getting louder and
                                more personal. Maybe it’s just a frustrating
                                assignment. Whatever it is, sense when you might
                                need to be somewhere else for a while. Have a
                                place in mind to hang out: maybe your house
                                lounge or a friend’s room. When in doubt, go to
                                the library. Yes, it’s polite to reserve alone
                                time in advance, but even the best roommate
                                can’t predict everything. Be gracious—you can
                                let them know afterward that a warning text
                                would be appreciated in the future. Hopefully,
                                when it’s your turn to need some space, they’ll
                                return the favor.

                                incompatible roommates are better off splitting
                                up than spilling blood. Your RH and RAs are
                                great resources for helping everybody get along,

                                truce between you, though, it’s best to jump
                                ship and find yourself a new room (along with a
                                new roommate.) Contact the Office of
                                Undergraduate Housing (6030 South Ellis Avenue,
                                773-702-7366) to get the ball rolling, but be
                                aware that there’s a three-week housing freeze
                                to start fall quarter. After that, switching
                                depends on your location, preferences, and the
                                vacancies that open up. Still, it’s better to go
                                out on a limb than to be miserable for the
                                better part of nine months. Don’t let yourself
                                get stuck in a bad situation, and don’t lose
                                hope—most roommate pairings work out. If you’re
                                one of the unlucky few, there are plenty of
                                resources at your disposal.

                                literally gives you as many meal swipes as you
                                need to satisfy your stomach. But with great

                                the most out of the different stations, you’ll
                                be able to get through first year no problem.

                                Bartlett is known for a sandwich station that
                                toasts its sandwiches, as well as a wood-fired
                                oven for pizza. Cathey stands apart for the
                                fresh veggies at the salad bar and the Mongolian
                                grill station, where you can watch your
                                vegetables and meat get stir-fried with the
                                sauce of your choice. Also important to know:
                                there’s a hazelnut-flavored coffee at Bartlett,
                                but not South. Captain Crunch is only served in
                                Bartlett, but Cathey more consistently has
                                Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

                                local Hyde Park restaurant. This is the one time
                                of the day where you’ll actually want to go to a

                                remain closed on Saturday nights to allow you to
                                branch out, explore Hyde Park, and go
                                downtown—but expect to spend a fair few ordering

                                UChicago’s student activism is marked by a focus
                                on issues that often radiate far beyond student
                                life. Issues range from increased awareness of
                                minority rights and status to the lack of an
                                adult trauma center at the University of Chicago
                                Medical Center, and many groups passionately
                                formed around major events that occurred
                                on-campus or off.

                                Probably the most visible protest last year
                                centered around addressing cultural intolerance
                                on campus. Students Against On-Campus Racial and
                                Ethnic Discrimination (SACRED) formed as a
                                reaction to two students’ racially charged
                                Halloween costumes. The group created a petition
                                signed by over 2,000 students that called for
                                the University to acknowledge and discipline the
                                students responsible. Despite these efforts, the
                                group was unsatisfied with the lack of response
                                from University administration. Soon afterward,
                                a student responsible for creating the petition
                                claimed that their Facebook had been hacked by a
                                group known as the UChicago Electronic Army (an
                                unofficial student organization). The “hacked”
                                status contained a racial slur and specifically
                                threatened another student on campus. President
                                Robert Zimmer immediately declared the status
                                hate speech and promised students that an
                                investigation would be forthcoming. However,
                                this response was not well-received by some
                                students, who believed that Zimmer was
                                responding to an isolated incident, and ignoring
                                a larger campus culture of racial intolerance.

                                are here” in Harper Memorial Library to show
                                that “institutionalized racism impedes student
                                learning.” The protest also garnered attention
                                on multiple social media platforms, with the
                                hashtag #liabilityofthemind, which was meant to
                                showcase the negative experiences of
                                marginalized students on campus.

                                Things came to a head when University officials
                                declared that the alleged Facebook hack was
                                actually fake; the student confirmed this on
                                Facebook saying “I am behind this, and only I.”
                                Fellow activist Vincente Perez claimed that the
                                student faked the hacking as a dramatic measure,
                                due to the lack of campus dialogue surrounding
                                racial issues. Despite this potential setback,
                                these protests and the general atmosphere of
                                student unrest did eventually spark some of the
                                campus dialogue SACRED was waiting for. Just
                                before the end of fall quarter, President Zimmer
                                announced that the University would issue two
                                campus climate surveys revolving around issues
                                of sexual assault and issues on race and
                                diversity. The University additionally

                                prevent the closure of these five smaller but
                                beloved buildings. Students were outraged to
                                receive an announcement that nine houses would
                                be moved from their dorms, renamed, and
                                integrated into Campus North Residence Hall in
                                the fall of 2016. Members of satellite houses
                                state they were never consulted during the
                                decision making process and that they are not
                                willing to give up their satellite dorms without
                                a fight. “[The University] assumed that we want
                                to live in a shiny new building. They assumed a
                                lot of things, and we need to confront those
                                underlying assumptions. They don’t understand

                                after the announcement, SOS held a town meeting
                                to discuss their cause; however, all

                                Probably the largest activist group on the south
                                side is the Trauma Center Coalition (TCC), which
                                is an umbrella group consisting of five smaller
                                community and University organizations: Students
                                for Health Equity (SHE), Fearless Leading the

                                Damien Turner was shot and subsequently died
                                while in transit to Northwestern Memorial
                                Hospital. Activists assert that if the
                                University of Chicago had its own trauma care
                                center to serve the south side, Turner’s life
                                could have been saved. Tensions boiled over this
                                year after the announcement that the University
                                would be bidding to host a Barack Obama
                                Presidential Library. Enraged that the
                                University is spending time and money on a bid
                                for library and not a trauma center, protesters
                                stormed a University fundraising event downtown,

                                due to gun trauma, due to economic violence, due

                                community members, rallied after the unanimous
                                passage of Illinois House Bill 3932 which
                                mandates that the UCPD and other private police
                                forces must follow the same laws of transparency
                                as public forces do under the Illinois Freedom
                                of Information Act (FOIA). The bill would not go
                                into effect, however, until it was additionally
                                passed by the Illinois State Senate and signed
                                by the governor. Protesters took issue with the
                                University press release that was sent out an
                                hour before the bill was passed. The release
                                stated that the UCPD would “go beyond the
                                requirements of Illinois law for police forces
                                at private institutions” by releasing daily
                                traffic stop data, field contact data, and
                                information on arrests by request only. However,
                                some UCPD data would still remain at the
                                discretion of the University, unless there was a
                                legal mandate forcing their release. Alex Ding
                                of CEP stated that the group was there to
                                “demand from the University a more transparent
                                and accountable University police force,” as the
                                UCPD has been known to “systematically racially
                                profile and harass…with complete impunity.”

                                restaurants nearly next door on 55th, but Snail
                                sticks out. Maybe it’s the festive seasonal
                                window decor, but then again, it’s probably the
                                irresistible Pad Thai and curry fried rice.

                                can come together. While students involved with

                                a Friday or Saturday night. On the eastern edge
                                of the quad, along South University Avenue,
                                you’ll find some of the oldest and most visible
                                reminders of Greek life: Psi Upsilon (Psi U),
                                Phi Delta Theta (Phi Delt), and Alpha Delta Phi
                                (Alpha Delt) fraternity houses. Just across from
                                Max, these frats will likely be the heart of the
                                O-Week party scene due to their proximity to
                                campus and their large houses. Another nearby
                                favorite is Delta Upsilon (DU) on Woodlawn.
                                Scattered across the rest of Hyde Park are Alpha
                                Epsilon Pi (AEPi), Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE),
                                Delta Tau Delta (DTD), Lambda Phi Epsilon
                                (Lambda), Sigma Phi Epsilon (Sig Ep), Sigma Chi,
                                and Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI), which moved
                                off-campus this past spring for house
                                renovations.

                                Many Greek systems will call their campus
                                presence unique, and we are no exception. Seeing
                                as this is the University of Chicago, our system
                                is definitely not what you’d expect if your
                                prior knowledge of Greek life is based on large
                                state schools. If you’re looking for
                                <em>Animal House</em> or
                                <em>Legally Blonde</em>, you’re in the wrong
                                place. None of the sororities have houses, and
                                the majority of fraternities are off-campus.
                                Taking into account that UChicago Greek life is
                                not necessarily traditional, why go Greek?
                            </p>
                            <p class="text">
                                Most students involved with Greek life would say
                                that the biggest draw is the community. By
                                joining a sorority or fraternity, you’re exposed
                                to people you probably would have never met
                                otherwise. The Panhellenic sororities have over
                                100 members each and fraternities often have 50
                                or more, so not everyone in your chapter is
                                going to be a close friend. But that’s okay. The
                                lasting friendships and memories you create with
                                the people you are close with make it all
                                worthwhile. Besides, the smaller size of the
                                UChicago Greek community makes it easy to get to
                                know people in other chapters besides your own,
                                so members are part of a larger network visible
                                at major campus events such as
                                <a href="http://www.ifsing.org" target="_blank"
                                    >InterFraternity Sing</a
                                >, which brings current and past Greek members
                                together to compete in a “traditional singing
                                competition.” During your college years, it’s
                                necessary to have some sort of support system,
                                and that’s often what a Greek chapter is: people
                                who are going to be there for you through the
                                highs and the lows. People are proud to belong
                                to these organizations and wear their
                                affiliation; you’ll see that many Greeks wear
                                their letters on a daily basis. The only way to
                                truly understand the commitment and dedication
                                Greek life inspires is to be a part of it.

                                Other draws include the opportunity to get
                                involved in philanthropy and the support of a
                                national network for college and beyond. Each of

                                Arthritis Foundation. Several fraternities also
                                host annual philanthropic events, such as DKE’s
                                Ian Woo Cummings Memorial Scholarship Run/Walk,

                                Huntington Foundation. On a smaller scale, Greek
                                life offers the opportunity to get involved by
                                organizing community service trips and
                                initiatives.

                                If you think Greek life is for you and are
                                considering rushing a fraternity or sorority,
                                remember that there is much to be gained from
                                trying it out and nothing to lose if you end up
                                deciding that it isn’t for you. You can always
                                continue to indulge in Bar Night, attend one of
                                the many philanthropy events, or choose not to
                                engage at all. Greek life is self-selective and
                                isn’t necessarily for everyone; for some people,
                                the sense of community one can find in Greek
                                brothers and sisters can be found in their house
                                or in RSOs. Additionally, there’s no pressure to
                                make this decision fall quarter of first year:
                                Fraternities have multiple rush classes per year
                                and formal sorority recruitment is made up of
                                about equal numbers of first- and second-years.
                                Meet the brothers and sisters, check out parties
                                or philanthropy events, and decide for yourself
                                whether or not you’re interested in joining this
                                community.

                                and publishes more extensive narratives and
                                essays. For students that have very specialized
                                interests, they can easily contribute to one of
                                the magazine’s diverse sections which range from
                                politics and education to food, books, art, and
                                music. It additionally provides more
                                opportunities for creative writers as the
                                publication often publishes poetry, fiction, and
                                original artwork.

                                (they even have matching sweatshirts).

                                        I am a very simple card. I am good at
                                        containing small bits of information. I
                                        am convenient because I require little

                                At UChicago the pictures may move, but you don’t
                                really have to; there are plenty of excellent
                                resources for the collegiate cinephile right on
                                campus. If you’re not looking to stray too far

                                exceptional choice. Doc began in 1932 as a
                                student-run film club that exclusively screened
                                documentaries (or, as its founders called them,
                                “the realist study of our time via nonfiction
                                film”). In 1940, the organization became firmly
                                established as the International House
                                Documentary Film Group. Since then, Doc has
                                expanded its repertoire and now screens
                                everything from flops to favorites.

                                because art was everywhere outside, in parks and
                                plazas. Trying to get a hold on public art at
                                the city center, I did a self-guided walking
                                tour of the Loop in the rain, sheltering under
                                the glass canopy above Chagall’s Four Seasons,
                                putting my face near the vibrant mosaic mural.
                                The other large sculptures en route were
                                deserted during the 20-minute storm that day.
                                The tour was free; it was in the community; most
                                important, it was beautiful.

                                Art in Chicago is also financially accessible,
                                thanks to the UChicago Arts Pass, your one-way
                                ticket to all art that isn’t in the public
                                domain. The pass itself is highly convenient to
                                acquire—its your UCID—and it grants free or
                                reduced admission to almost every major Chicago
                                art institution, including theaters, concert

                                course, museums. For what the Arts Pass doesn’t
                                cover, there’s usually a reduced student ticket

                                Let’s take it from the beginning. The beginning
                                of what, you may ask? How about the Big Ten
                                Conference. Our Maroons were co-founders back in
                                1896, along with a list of schools whose
                                athletics remain on the national stage to this
                                day.

                                Chicago was a force in the Midwest during the 40
                                years that Amos Alonzo Stagg coached the
                                football squad (1892–1932). Yes, that’s the same
                                Stagg whose name adorns the trophy awarded to
                                the winner of the Big Ten each year in football,
                                and our very own football field on campus. Stagg
                                led the Maroons to six Big Ten championships
                                (seven if you count the 1922 shared title with
                                Iowa and Michigan).

                                And Stagg’s victories extended beyond his
                                time—the Statue of Liberty play that Boise State
                                used to win the 2007 Fiesta Bowl was partially
                                Stagg’s creation, while coaching here in 1908.

                                The coaching, of course, wasn’t the only
                                exciting element to early 1900s Maroon sports.
                                The players possessed certifiable, DI-level
                                talent, too—which helped Stagg and other coaches
                                look good. One crucial chess piece of his was
                                Jay Berwanger.

                                Berwanger was the first recipient of the Heisman
                                Trophy, still awarded each year to the best
                                player in college football. The halfback was
                                given the honor in 1935, when it was called the
                                Downtown Athletic Club Trophy. The next year,
                                they renamed it the Heisman, and that name
                                stuck. For those who doubt that the Maroons
                                could ever reign supreme on the gridiron,
                                Berwanger’s Heisman trophy sits in the middle of
                                the Ratner Athletic Center rotunda.

                                Long before Title IX, female Maroons were
                                putting on a show as well. Between 1898 and
                                1935, Gertrude Dudley served as director of
                                “physical culture” for women. She organized
                                multiple female teams and crusaded for more
                                women’s sports at the University.

                                background. The South Siders left the Big Ten in
                                1946, after University President Robert Maynard
                                Hutchins decided to eliminate the University’s
                                varsity football team in 1939.

                                sports conference. This time, it was the NCAA
                                DIII University Athletic Association, also known
                                as the UAA.

                                has the ability to truly know who he’s rooting

                                This O-Week, first-years will undoubtedly enter
                                Ratner Athletics Center to get in a quick run,
                                lift some weights, or even check out the first
                                Heisman Trophy won by Jay Berwanger in 1935.
                                Swiping those students through the turnstile
                                will likely be four-year Michael Bennett.
                                Bennett won the NCAA Division III Indoor
                                National Title in the pole vault two years ago.
                                The only thing he does better than pole vaulting
                                is talking, and he will be ecstatic to meet new
                                people. As you take your first Sosc class, you
                                might even find second-year Nicholas Chua
                                sitting next to you, discussing Aquinas’s
                                definition of law. Chua won the ITA title in
                                men’s tennis as a first-year. As a Maroon, you
                                may very well meet both of them by the end of
                                your first quarter.

                                Chicago has a tight-knit community, and when you

                                relationship does. Chicago provides Maroons with
                                an opportunity to really get to know Maroon
                                athletes. That’s what separates the 1,000-seat
                                stadiums of Chicago from the 100,000-seat
                                stadiums at large state schools.

                                feature more than just friendly faces. They
                                display dominance in their own right. Maroons
                                strive for excellence in everything they do: on
                                the field, in the classroom, and in the
                                community. Last year Chicago placed 20th in the
                                DIII Directors Cup, which ranks athletic
                                departments by the success of their teams. The
                                Maroons featured a handful of conference
                                champions, a slew of All-Americans, and a
                                boatload of winning programs.

                                company. Chicago gathers young men and women who
                                are unique and different but share a passion to
                                achieve excellence, whether in the classroom, on

                                during fall and spring quarters. When the

                                Chicago’s sporting field is wide, so do yourself
                                a favor and be a sports fanatic. You don’t have
                                to be a White Sox, Cubs, Blackhawks, Bulls, or
                                Bears fan. In fact, you can be the opposite. All
                                you have to do is be willing to sit through
                                three hours—an afternoon unlike any you’ll find

                                Chapel, which is held twice a week in the early
                                evening. The class is aimed at relaxing you, and
                                Meredith Haggerty, who leads the program, will
                                often give you a few dabs of essential oil at

                                policymakers, publishing countless books within

                                passions on a daily basis. While the University
                                boasts a large list of world-famous faculty,
                                it’s important to consider other factors when

                                guide to dealing with University professors and
                                teaching assistants (TA’s):
                            </p>
                            <p class="text"><strong> Office Hours</strong></p>
                            <p class="text">
                                Attending office hours is an excellent way to
                                develop meaningful relationships with
                                professors, especially in large lecture classes
                                where a professor may never be able to learn
                                your name otherwise. You can ask questions you
                                might have been too afraid to ask in class, go
                                over assignments, talk through ideas and
                                outlines for a paper, go over missed exam
                                questions, or discuss a difficult homework
                                assignment. Professors are required to set aside
                                time specifically devoted to meeting with their
                                students, so it’s a great idea to take advantage
                                of the opportunity to further your educational
                                experiences in the class. Even if you don’t need
                                help with anything specific, office hours are a
                                chance for the professor to appreciate that you

                                Course evaluations are a great way to learn
                                about the class offerings every quarter and read
                                reviews left by students who have previously
                                taken the class. However, it’s important to
                                remember that evaluations often suffer from
                                response bias: Students who loved the class are
                                inclined to respond with an outstanding review
                                of the professor, and students who absolutely
                                hated the class will write a scathing diatribe
                                defiling the professor. In order to avoid the
                                pitfalls of inconsistent evaluations, it helps
                                to try out different sections of the course
                                during the first week of the quarter, especially
                                for Hum, Sosc, and Civ classes and other
                                discussion-based courses. Some professors are
                                extremely adept at facilitating discussion,
                                while others can struggle to get everyone
                                talking. The only way to truly determine what
                                professor’s class will work best for you is to
                                experience each class first hand. Barring the
                                ability to acquire a time-turner and go to
                                overlapping sections, if everyone in a class
                                evaluated it similarly, that’s a good bet—and if
                                you’re on the fence, all-around positive
                                evaluations can help tip the scales toward a
                                topic you might not have tried otherwise.

                                fear not: Younger professors often tend to

                                and generally have more time to devote to their

                                students, often making it less intimidating to

                                Upon your first visit to UChicago, the first
                                library you’ll notice is the imposing Regenstein
                                Library, or “the Reg.” Notable for its location
                                on the site of the University’s former football
                                stadium, Stagg Field, the symbolism is not lost
                                on students or administrators, most of whom
                                recognize the Reg’s importance as the de facto
                                hub of University activity.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text">
                                On any given day, one can see the Reg populated
                                by economics study groups in the A-Level,
                                coffee-addled writers with a looming deadline,
                                and idle students who pretend to work but just
                                want a place to chill. Tables are arranged
                                throughout the seven floors (nowhere quite as
                                concentrated as the interconnected second and
                                third floors) but for those seeking comfort and
                                possibly a quick nap, a better bet might be the
                                couches arranged near the windows. Those
                                interested in privacy should take solace in the
                                equally widespread cubicles that are
                                interspersed on almost all floors.

                                The Reg might not be known for its positive,
                                chilled-out vibes or the niche that it serves,
                                but it instead makes its presence known through
                                sheer scope and widespread usefulness. Whatever
                                your needs are, they can most likely be served
                                in some fashion by the Reg’s extensive
                                collection.

                                Just a short hallway away, the Joe and Rika
                                Mansueto Library offers a new study experience.
                                Rows of desks with charging outlets fill the
                                domed structure, and the extreme silence that
                                pervades the area makes it clear that this is an
                                exclusively study-oriented space. Mansueto is so
                                quiet that even the sounds of students packing
                                up and leaving often draw restless looks from
                                the other patrons, sneezes or coughs prompting
                                death stares. The flipside to this, of course,
                                is that this is one of the prime studying areas
                                on campus: free of distractions, home to an
                                underground 3.5 million–book storage area that
                                is OPERATED BY A ROBOT, and still within short
                                walking distance of dining commons. Several
                                movies, TV shows, and ad campaigns have been
                                filmed in Mansueto since it opened in 2011.

                                steps away from the Med and Z&amp;H. The small
                                awning outside boasts a shingled roof and a
                                mossy exterior, lit by a single light bulb.
                                Further, you have to venture down a number of
                                stairs to enter the bookstore, giving the
                                impression of entering an underground cave.
                                Inside, the store is reminiscent of a treehouse,
                                lined with books and various nooks in which to
                                sit and leaf through a large selection of
                                reading materials. The rooms are arranged by

                                recommendations are taped to almost every shelf,

                                a particular book or series; these are
                                especially helpful for the times that you might

                                Powell’s Bookstore features two locations in
                                Chicago; the one closer to campus is located
                                halfway between University Avenue and the Point.
                                This Hyde Park staple takes up a large
                                storefront on 57th Street and boasts an
                                incredibly dense selection of books, both new
                                and old. Be sure to take advantage of the almost
                                omnipresent cardboard box of free books outside
                                of the store, containing free novels,
                                anthologies, and much more. The best part is
                                that Powell’s sells its books far below full
                                price, usually just a couple of dollars. As it
                                is a used bookstore, the selection is far more
                                varied than your usual Barnes &amp; Noble, with
                                cool finds like British editions of Harry
                                Potter, an entire basement section dedicated to
                                biographies of Jack the Ripper, and copies of a
                                book titled <em>Chasing Vermeer</em>, in which
                                Powell’s serves as the story’s backdrop. It’s
                                easy to wander aimlessly between the stacks
                                (some of which reach all the way up to the
                                ceiling) for hours, but for those times where
                                you’re looking for a particular book, it’s good
                                to have an idea of where various genres are
                                located within the store. Fiction is right ahead
                                when you walk through the door, foreign language
                                is downstairs, and an amazing selection of
                                antique books is located in the depths of the
                                basement. Powell’s also has a great selection of
                                books in virtually every academic discipline, so
                                it’s worth a visit when picking up course

                                (“collective effervescence”), soaked into our

                                All first-years are required to take Hum
                                (pronounced “Hume”), which delves into the
                                philosophy and literature foundational to
                                (primarily) Western thought. A cornerstone of
                                the Core, Hum can offer you access to different
                                collections of literary and philosophical
                                thought, depending on the class you choose. Take
                                something more traditional like Human Being and
                                Citizen, and you will spend at least two
                                quarters reading the great books, from Homer’s
                                <em>Iliad</em> to Aristotle’s
                                <em>Nicomachaean Ethics</em> and Dante’s
                                <em>Inferno</em>. Readings in World Literature,
                                on the other hand, ventures beyond the Western
                                canon with works like the <em>Mahabharata</em>.

                                pronounced “Sosh”) sequence during your first
                                year. Credit ambiguously named classes like
                                “Power, Identity, and Resistance” and “Self,
                                Culture, and Society” for all those Arendt,

                                make after taking them. Sosc allows you to delve
                                into the history of political philosophy or,
                                even better, learn how to develop social and
                                political theories of your own. Considered a
                                more “practical” option for the Core, Social
                                Science Inquiry gives you the foundation to
                                carry out your own social science research,
                                while Mind allows you to circumvent the classics

                                In addition to Hum, the Core has both Art and
                                Civilizations (“Civ”) requirements. You must
                                take six quarters among these three disciplines,
                                with no less than one quarter in each. Choose
                                from the likes of the theoretical (art history,
                                music theory) and the hands-on (drawing,
                                theater) for the art portion of your core. But
                                beware: Because of the small class sizes and
                                high demand, core art classes become
                                increasingly difficult to nab as you progress
                                through your four years. Bid early, bid often.
                                For Civ, it is (not surprisingly) a popular
                                option to enroll in a study abroad program and
                                spend one quarter frolicking around cities such
                                as Barcelona, Istanbul, Beijing, and
                                Oaxaca—although the new Gender Studies Civ could
                                be equally uncharted territory.

                                language as part of the Core—the completion of
                                an introductory sequence, or its equivalent in

                                requires six quarters, with a minimum of two
                                quarters each in natural sciences, physical
                                sciences, and math. A general Core Bio course,

                                sequence can serve as an alternative); physical

                                Statistics and computer science are both
                                accepted for your math requirement. A.P. or I.B.
                                credit can waive many of these classes.

                                practice. There will be times when you are up at
                                the witching hour, cursing your past self,
                                thinking “What sequence of events brought me to

                                will read will bear an answer. Well, except for
                                Marx and his theory of alienation. And maybe
                                Freud—yeah, I could see that. And in a twisted
                                way, this is the Core at its finest: tediously,
                                sometimes even painfully, gifting you an

                                On the surface, choosing a major at UChicago is
                                a relatively straightforward task: take a few
                                classes based on personal and/or professional
                                interest to test the waters, and simply declare
                                by spring of third year. This generally just
                                entails submitting an online request and, if you
                                want to avoid a prodding e-mail, informing your
                                College adviser.
                            </p>

                                Every major, of course, has its own
                                rules—certain programs have more stringent
                                prerequisites that need to be fulfilled before
                                declaring, while others require an application
                                for admission. A major may comprise only 11
                                courses (Law, Letters, and Society) or it may
                                require 19 (biochemistry)—and the numbers may
                                even differ depending on the area of
                                specialization within the same major. Minors
                                usually require about half as many credits.

                                Many students nonetheless arrive at the
                                University without a clue as to what their major
                                will be. And that’s perfectly fine; you have so
                                much time to figure it out. Everyone will tell

                            <p class="text">
                                First, there are a lot of economics majors on
                                campus. Perhaps due to the deservedly famed
                                reputation of the department, which prompts
                                adages like, “You can’t come to UChicago and NOT
                                do econ,” or perhaps due to the odd association
                                between the econ major and future financial
                                success for those aspiring Patrick Bateman
                                types. Based on the most recent quantitative
                                data released by the registrar, out of 5,334
                                enrolled College students, there were 840
                                official econ majors as of spring 2013. The
                                second and third most popular majors were
                                biological sciences (481 students), and
                                political science (406 students). The least
                                popular majors currently are Jewish studies and
                                South Asian studies, with two students each.

                                Second, a favorite UChicago pastime is majoring
                                in twos and threes. Many students decide to
                                double major every year, and the University’s
                                official spiel on this tradition is that,
                                professionally speaking, it usually does not
                                make a difference. An even smaller collegiate
                                clique opts to try their hands at the
                                masochistic rigors of a triple major, and often
                                finds it to be a Sisyphean, but happy, struggle.
                                As of the spring of 2013, 1,072 students had
                                officially declared a double major, while 54
                                declared a triple.

                                Of course, this also wouldn’t be UChicago
                                without the smattering of idiosyncratic, and
                                interdisciplinary majors offered by the New
                                Collegiate Division. For instance, Fundamentals:
                                Issues and Texts majors seek to answer one
                                deceptively basic question (for example, “How
                                does one love?” or “What is desperation?”) by
                                focusing intensely on a few chosen texts, hence
                                the name. The required introductory course could
                                cover many works of one author, or focus on a
                                single book, most of which are read an
                                excruciating (but theoretically rewarding)
                                minimum of three times.

                                financial aid, it’s a good idea to contact the

                                aid, and there are also in-person counseling
                                services available. If you want clarification on

                                useful resource when it comes to everyday
                                practicalities, providing free laptops to borrow

                                some core classes. Wilson also noted that SDA
                                has put together a resource guide that gives
                                students detailed information aimed at helping

                                difficulty—oftentimes, students managing an

                                not want to ask for help, and SDA attempts to
                                combat those feelings of isolation through the
                                creation of open and honest discussions about
                                class issues (of which there will be several

                                this course would meet the entire civilization

                                Fourth-year Joshua Harris said that his study
                                abroad experience enabled him to enjoy his
                                passion for the arts. “I had the time of my life
                                studying English literature in the heart of
                                London as part of the University’s British
                                literature program. In the classroom, we studied
                                renaissance poetry and the black Londoner
                                literatures (writings of the British colonial
                                protectorates in the Caribbean) but on my own
                                and with friends. On the program, I had the
                                opportunity to explore my loves, music and
                                theatre. I saw some of the most amazing
                                productions in London's west end, as well as a
                                Van Morrison show in a small club—neither of
                                which I am soon to forget,” Harris said.

                                The University was founded by John D.
                                Rockefeller and the American Baptist Education
                                Society, and funded by Baptists around the
                                country and Chicago philanthropists. The
                                University quickly acquired land along the
                                Midway from Marshall Field, and quickly began
                                acquiring additional real estate in Hyde Park as
                                the campus sprang up. Throughout its history the
                                University frequently used real estate to gain
                                and leverage influence, a practice that still
                                defines its relationship with the neighborhood
                                and the city.

                                The University’s control of real estate often
                                took a racial and economic tone. As early as
                                1909, the University began informally supporting
                                neighborhood associations that were focused on
                                maintaining racial separation. This legalized
                                discrimination often took the form of
                                restrictive covenants, which the *Chicago

                                Chicago Agreement to get rid of the Negros”. The
                                University also amassed real estate, often
                                hiding its ownership in the name of
                                administrators, in order to gain ownership of
                                the land immediately bordering it.

                                Following World War II the University increased
                                its emphasis on real estate and urban planning,
                                working with local organizations, like the Hyde
                                Park–Kenwood Community Council, to maintain a

                                African-Americans began moving into the area. In
                                1950, 88 percent of the area was rentals, many
                                owned by the University, giving it a wide degree
                                of control over Hyde Park real estate. The
                                University created the South East Chicago
                                Commission in 1952 in order to lead its
                                neighborhood renewal plan.

                                not without controversy. In 2011 the University
                                signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the
                                City of Chicago, committing billions to city
                                projects and job development in the area. The
                                University also led a redevelopment of the 53rd
                                Street corridor, attracting a mix of national

                                other states are more corrupt than Illinois.
                                Unfortunately, Anchorage corruption isn’t as
                                interesting as Chicago corruption.

                                The City of Chicago is governed by a mayor and a
                                city council made up of 50 Aldermen. The current
                                mayor, Rahm Emanuel, has been in office since
                                2011. Previously, Emanuel served as President
                                Obama’s chief of staff and was a congressman
                                representing Chicago’s north side. So far his
                                tenure has been short by Chicago standards.
                                Former mayor Richard J. Daley represented the
                                city for 21 years and his son Richard M. Daley
                                represented the city for 22 years.

                                Welcome to the South Side, your section in
                                Chicago for the next four years. Comprising 60
                                percent of the land area of the city, the South
                                Side contains many of the city’s most diverse
                                neighborhoods. While headlines
                                disproportionately focus on the Obama family and
                                violence, the South Side has a rich history and
                                present vitality, embodying some of the best
                                Chicago has to offer.

                                To start off, what are the boundaries of the
                                South Side? While the crossroads of Chicago’s
                                North/South and East/West divide is at State and
                                Madison, many exclude the Loop from definitions
                                of the South Side, often citing Roosevelt Road
                                as the beginning of the South Side. The area
                                stretches all the way to the 138th Street, the
                                southernmost city boundary.

                                The South Side began booming in the 1840s, when
                                industrial development and meatpacking attracted
                                migrants to crowd into the areas surrounding
                                opportunity. The annexation of several
                                independent townships (including Hyde Park!) in
                                1889 increased the scope of the South Side. As
                                African-American migration began following the
                                end of slavery and then accelerated in the early
                                20th century during the Great Migration, they
                                were pushed into concentrated areas and formed
                                Chicago’s famous Black Belt.

                                Racial segregation is undeniably a part of the
                                South Side’s history, creating many of the urban
                                issues that exist today. From the 1919 race
                                riots to the Contract Buyer’s League, the
                                evidence of the many forms of oppression,
                                ranging from physical violence to restrictive
                                contracts to stigma, are obvious today. It’s
                                impossible to denigrate the South Side as a
                                problem-ridden area without acknowledging the
                                political, economic, and social forces that
                                conspired together. The contraction of American
                                industry in the 1960s and ensuing white flight
                                worsened the region’s situation in the present
                                day.

                                exists within the different neighborhoods. From
                                Chinatown, with its strip of distinctive

                                originally a segregated white middle class
                                enclave before integrating in the 1960s and
                                becoming a predominantly black community.

                                Jews and blacks until its closure in 1973. After
                                the country club closed, local activists and
                                preservationists saved the buildings and turned
                                them into a public space, open to all. Today,
                                the center offers art classes, a nature

                                food, from the vegetarian, rice-based cuisine of

                                neighborhood. Either end of Paseo Boricua is
                                unmistakably marked by 60-foot Puerto Rican
                                flags towering over Division Avenue. Food-wise,
                                Humboldt Park is the birthplace of the jibarito
                                sandwich, which wisely passes on bread for an
                                outer layer of plantains, held together with a
                                garlic mayonnaise, meat, cheese, lettuce and
                                tomato. In addition to the relatively young
                                jibarito, Humboldt Park also offers an exquisite
                                variety of traditional Puerto Rican dishes,
                                including some of the best roast chicken you’ll
                                ever have (Nellie’s: try it).

                                Lou Maltini’s – Deep dish pizza is synonymous
                                with Chicago, and the city has three competing
                                chains – Giordano’s, Gino’s, and Lou Maltini’s.
                                Really, how can you go wrong with what is
                                essentially a pizza casserole? I recommend Lou
                                Maltini’s simply because it tends to have less
