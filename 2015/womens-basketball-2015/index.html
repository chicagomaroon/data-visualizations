                        Athletics Center was transformed. The architects behind

                        the impact,” Roussell said. “I think we took a moment
                        after number 25, after the Wash U game, to just say ‘oh
                        my god, guys, we haven’t talked about this all year, but

                        They shared this year’s conference title with Wash U.
                        The fourth-years, along with head coach Carissa Sain
                        Knoche and the entire coaching staff, anchored a team
                        that finished atop the UAA for the first time since

                        They entered the game 10–0, having not yet played a

                        sixth in the UAA for Devaney, and sixth in the UAA for
                        Simpson in 2011-12.

                        As for Simpson’s notch of second in the UAA in field
                        goal percentage at 56.4, Devaney, too, finished second
                        in the UAA there this year, with a 52.4 percentage.

                        The similarities don’t end there. In 2011-12, Joann
                        Torres was fourth in the UAA with a 40.6 3-pt field goal
                        percentage. This year? First-year Elizabeth Nye finished
                        fourth in the UAA with a 37.3 mark.

                        are an underappreciated element of the game that helped
