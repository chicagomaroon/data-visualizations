                        The year after his retirement in 1951, former University
                        President Robert Maynard Hutchins stood before a select
                        committee from the United States House of
                        Representatives to declare that, “Education is a kind of
                        continuing dialogue, and a dialogue assumes, in the
                        nature of the case, different points of view.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Though Hutchins was talking about the difference in
                        opinion that often rears its head in the seminar room,
                        his words could just as accurately summarize the
                        continuing—and at times heated—dialogue between a
                        university’s administration and its faculty. At the
                        University of Chicago, it was Hutchins’s presidency that
                        would see greater faculty representation through the
                        establishment of governing bodies like the Council of
                        the University Senate and the Committee of the Council.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        But the story of faculty representation has not been
                        that simple. Rather, since these bodies’ inception
                        during Hutchins’ presidency, the debate over faculty’s
                        exact powers and limitations has only intensified.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        To examine the powers of faculty, it is first necessary
                        to understand the powers of the two other major
                        governing powers at the University: the Board of
                        Trustees and the administration. Divinity School
                        Professor Bruce Lincoln said that the president’s role
                        has always been to reconcile the interests of both the
                        faculty and the Board of Trustees. “The Board of
                        Trustees has responsibility for all financial matters at
                        the University and the faculty have all responsibility
                        for academic matters at the University,” Lincoln said.
                        “It’s implicit that sometimes these two bodies will see
                        things differently, and it’s the Office of the President
                        that is supposed to resolve those matters.”

                        For this reason, most American university presidents
                        have held a large amount of power out of necessity. “You
                        need a strong president to set an agenda,” said Dean of
                        the College John W. Boyer, “to persuade the public, to
                        defend our interests, to explain to people what a
                        university is and what it’s not.”

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        When he was appointed president in 1929, Hutchins seemed
                        to fit all of these criteria. Charismatic and dynamic,
                        he was more than just a university president; he was an
                        ideologue who wanted the University of Chicago to be at
                        the forefront of educational innovation. But his
                        idealistic educational theories were radical, and many
                        of Hutchins’s most dramatic reforms were made without
                        consulting the Board of Trustees and faculty. Most
                        undesirably, Hutchins abolished majors at the University
                        of Chicago, instead pushing a four-year general “Core”
                        education curriculum that was open to qualified students
                        of any age, including those still in high school.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Hutchins’s far-reaching reforms were unlike any
                        previously seen in undergraduate education, and faculty
                        members—many of whose Ph.D. programs were
                        threatened—railed against them. “What Hutchins was doing
                        was tampering with basic pedagogical structures,” Boyer
                        said. “Telling a department you can’t have a major,
                        telling a department your Ph.D. students aren’t going to
                        write doctoral dissertations—these are very deep,
                        probing interventions.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        They were also interventions that, in the end, largely
                        failed. Contrary to his expectations, Hutchins’s radical
                        changes didn’t catch on at other elite universities, and
                        his decision to eliminate majors repelled students in
                        droves. “Our bachelor’s degree had become degraded,”
                        Boyer explained. “Students graduating from the College
                        couldn’t get jobs. When they’d apply to medical school
                        and law school, [those schools] would make them go for
                        another couple of years at another college to get more
                        training.”

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        In the mid 1940s, when most of these changes were being
                        implemented despite popular outcry, the only vehicle for
                        faculty governance was the University Senate, which had
                        almost no direct representative power and was composed
                        of only full-time professors. Hutchins’s rash flurry of
                        autocratic decisions prompted the Board of Trustees and
                        faculty to change this, and in 1945, they established
                        both the Council of the University Senate and the
                        Committee of the Council. The Council of the Senate
                        would act as a further representative body made up of
                        elected members of the Senate, and the Committee of the
                        Council, in turn, would be an even smaller group elected
                        by the Council that would work directly with the
                        President. Under the new organization of powers,
                        enfranchisement in the University Senate was extended
                        beyond those with full professorship to include
                        associate and assistant professors.

                        Structurally, these governmental bodies have essentially
                        remained the same since their inception. In the end, it
                        was Hutchins’s extreme reforms that lacked staying
                        power: The faculty all but unanimously agreed to
                        overturn his general education curriculum after he left
                        the University in 1951.

                        For Boyer, the Hutchins crisis was, in many ways,
                        similar to a conflict that he experienced firsthand as
                        dean of the College in the late 1990s. During this
                        period, then-President Hugo Sonnenschein called for a
                        dramatic expansion of the undergraduate population,
                        which had never entirely recovered from the shock of the
                        Hutchins era.

                        Presidents before Sonnenschein had increased the size of
                        the College incrementally, but Sonnenschein’s call to
                        accept as many as 1,000 more undergraduates met with
                        considerable backlash. Many faculty members felt as

                        retired in 1999, agrees that there were parallels
                        between the Hutchins conflict and Sonnenschein’s
                        expansion plan. Whereas in the 1940s professors clashed
                        with Hutchins on his total upheaval of traditional Ph.D.
                        programs, under Sonnenschein the underlying fear was
                        that faculty would be forced to teach more undergraduate
                        courses, detracting from time otherwise spent mentoring
                        graduate students or conducting independent research. In
                        both cases, faculty felt as though the University’s
                        reputation as a premier graduate and research-oriented
                        institution was being compromised. “When you start
                        putting emphasis on the undergraduate program, it calls
                        up memories of those days when there was this intense
                        battle between researchers and the Hutchins–College
                        crowd,” he explained. “There was a strong institutional

                        As dean of the College at this time, Boyer found himself
                        caught between two strongly divided camps: the
                        anti-expansion position, pushed by a faculty contingent,
                        and the pro-expansion position, advanced by Sonnenschein
                        and a number of faculty leaders. To reach a decision,
                        Boyer did what any historian would do: plenty of

                        operate a major university is to have a large, thriving
                        college. Nobody planned it this way; Hutchins thought

                        The problem for Rothenberg, Lincoln, and many faculty

                        well-being and integrity of the University, either
                        politically or intellectually. Rothenberg viewed the

                        to pass down the ideas of Milton Friedman to students at
                        the University. “It was ‘one of those institutes,’” said

                        The Grossman Institute faced similar backlash. Economist
                        and University Trustee Sanford Grossman aspired to
                        further the study of “quantitative biometrics,” in which
                        researchers determine whether there are hardwired
                        biological factors that correlate with certain kinds of
                        personality structure and action decisions. While
                        Grossman had originally envisioned building a
                        neuroscience research center, he was later influenced to
                        instead focus on the study of economic decision making.

                        neuroscientists [at the University] were unhappy and
                        thought the proposal dubious. In Council, the discussion

                        neuroscientists had wanted in the first place, Lincoln
                        states that the Council should have been able to
                        intervene earlier without administrative interference.
                        “In the face of strong opposition, the administration

                        The faculty divide over the Friedman Institute further
                        spurred debate on the true powers and limitations of the
                        statutes. As debate intensified, there was a call among
                        faculty members to defer to the statutes and bylaws that
                        outlined the powers of the governing bodies on campus.
                        All those involved knew that the statutes very clearly
                        indicated that faculty approval is necessary for the
                        establishment of new departments and schools, but the
                        question was if this jurisdiction extended to the
                        establishment of new research institutes. Because no
                        powers were explicitly granted by the statutes, the
                        Council appointed a committee of faculty to analyze and
                        interpret these documents.

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        The committee ended up splitting into two factions with
                        completely different findings. “There was a majority
                        [committee] that said the faculty really had serious
                        powers here, and the other [committee] said, ‘No, the
                        faculty really only has power to give advice and the
                        decisions rest with the administration,’” Lincoln said.

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Before the committee’s findings were announced, the
                        president appointed his own committee to analyze the
                        statutes, who interpreted them as solely granting
                        jurisdictional power to the administration. Though one
                        of the faculty-appointed groups had reached this
                        conclusion independently, many members of the Council
                        were baffled and disheartened by the administration’s
                        brusque overruling of their own findings. “By my
                        perception, [the faculty’s] argument was superior to the
                        one posed by the administration, and structurally, they
                        were given much less voice in the decisions that got
                        made, and ultimately, less voice than the statutes
                        mandated they should have had,” Lincoln said.

                        Friedman Institute. “Eventually, we made a fuss about
                        it, and there was enough bad publicity and conflict on
                        campus that what they did was combine it with the Becker
                        Institute,” Rothenberg said. “It became a much

                        which is funded by the Chinese government and has been
                        accused of academic censorship. “All of my instincts of
                        the past came into play,” Lincoln recalled. “I thought,

                        integrity of the University.’ We were permitting the
                        classroom to become a vehicle for state propaganda, and

                        the principle of the issue should stand regardless of
                        which country is funding the institute. “[The Confucius

                        But in retrospect, Lincoln believes that relations
                        between faculty and the administration have improved
                        since the days of the Grossman Institute, Friedman
                        Institute, and Confucius Institute. “The battles were
                        fought, and they were unpleasant. People pounded the
                        table, people got angry, and there were hurt feelings
                        and there were accusations made back and forth [that]
                        were probably overstated. But in the wake of it, I think
                        the administration is less determined to have its way,”
                        Lincoln said. “The Confucius Institute resolved very
                        nicely…. There was a serious discussion, and objections
                        got heard. Ultimately, the institution made a decision
                        that wasn’t just based on finances. I think things are
                        better than they were at the time of the Friedman
                        Institute and the Grossman Institute, in part because of
                        those struggles.”

                        While Lincoln has certainly seen an advance in the way
                        in which the administration now handles controversial
                        matters, he still believes that there is plenty of room
                        for improvement with administration and faculty
                        relations. In particular, he envisions a future in which
                        the faculty and the Board of Trustees are two spheres of
                        influence with mutual respect for one another.

                        “In recent decades, Boards of Trustees have been more
                        activist than they’ve used to be. They’ve wanted to play
                        a bigger role in shaping the institution,” said Lincoln.
                        “My opinion is that the Trustees should make sure there
                        is enough money for what the faculty want to do. That’s
                        how a university ought to run. The Trustees run their
                        corporations, and if they’re interested in academic
                        matters, they should trust academics to tell them what’s
                        important and what’s worth doing. We’re not a production
                        line. We’re not a corporate entity. Knowledge doesn’t
                        work the way products do.”

                        That’s a point with which former President Hutchins
                        would almost certainly agree. Though the battle for
                        greater faculty representation began with his
                        contentious, controlling presidency, there’s no question
                        that Hutchins had the best academic interests of the
                        University in mind throughout. “I remember 20 years ago
                        when I just started [as dean of the College], I was
                        talking to older faculty—who were young faculty in the
                        ’30s and ’40s—and what they remember is the vibrancy of
                        the place,” Boyer said of the Hutchins era. “[They had]
                        a president who gave speeches on higher education, who
                        believed in ideas, who was constantly talking about the
                        ideas associated with the University, and when he
                        resigned, they missed him, even though at the time some
                        of them hated his guts.”

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        So it has been with all presidents since: In juggling
                        the interests of both the faculty and the Board of
                        Trustees, the Office of the President is certainly
                        indebted to both bodies, but at the end of the day,
                        decisions must be made for what is best for the
                        University, and futures must be considered.

                        “Do I think presidents sometimes force things through?
                        Yeah, sometimes,” said Boyer. “They should have a lot of
                        prerogative, a lot of opportunities to influence the
                        shaping of the university. But the best ones understand
                        that they have to cooperate with at least a significant
                        share of the faculty.”
