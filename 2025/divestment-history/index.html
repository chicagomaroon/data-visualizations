                    that week in Illinois, indicating curiosity and even confusion about
                    protesters' demands. To better understand the context behind
                    the recent surge in activism, the <i>Maroon</i>'s data desk
                    dove into our digital archives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <i>Maroon</i>'s records reveal that the history of
                    divestment activism at UChicago spans seven major causes,
                    various approaches to activism, and a wide range of
                    responses from the University administration. According to
                    the archives, students first protested for divestment on
                    January 23, 1967, when 200 protestors picketed in front of
                    Continental Illinois Bank to oppose the University's use of a bank that made loans to the South African apartheid government.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later that year, a committee appointed by then University of
                    Chicago President George Beadle released the
                    <a
                        href="https://chicagomaroon.github.io/data-visualizations/2025/kalven-report-annotated/"
                        >Kalven Report</a
                    >, a document which recommended that academic institutions
                    refrain from taking official stances on social issues in
                    order to protect free speech.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the next half century, members of the campus community
                    attempted, through writing letters, holding rallies, and
                    even filing legal complaints, to help shape the moral
                    direction of the university through its purse. In response,
                    the University administration has <a href="https://chicagomaroon.com/23311/news/zimmer-zigs-zags-around-campus-issues-maroon/">cited</a> the Kalven Report as
                    the primary reason that it has abstained from substantially
                    engaging on the divestment issue. The ultimate outcome of
                    this deadlock seems to hinge on a fundamental question: What
                    right does the campus community have to exert influence over
                    its institution?

                        Palestine-related divestment activism at UChicago, marking over a
                        decade since this idea was broached on campus. Momentum on the issue 
                        built steadily until it peaked with last year's encampment.

                    once per major movement, campus administration has agreed to
                    give interviews with student newspapers, published opinion
                    essays explaining their stance, or presented at public

                        protestors by University or city police, for a total of

                        students' championed causes in other ways.

                        I believe the protesters should also consider that an
                        encampment, with all the etymological connections of the
                        word to military origins, is a way of using force of a
                        kind rather than reason to persuade others. For a short
                        period of time, however, the impact of a modest
                        encampment does not differ so much from a conventional
                        rally or march.

                    With only the above email as context, a member of campus
                    might have assumed that last year's demonstrations had no
                    precedent beyond pro-Palestine activism. Yet the <i>Maroon</i>'s
                    archives reveal a longer history, in which campus activists
                    used various forms of reason to persuade the administration
                    to divest. It seems at times as if history is repeating
                    itself, as each new generation rediscovers divestment and
                    each new administration blocks it. Universities are
                    certainly peculiar environments: excluding faculty and staff, they are some of the only institutions with almost
                    100 percent turnover every four years. Institutional
                    knowledge is incredibly difficult to retain. And yet, this
                    constant churn of ideas may be a double-edged sword:
                    universities are also historically at the forefront of
                    social change.

                    the idea of institutional neutrality among colleges, in the
                    fifty years since, campus activists have persisted in
                    arguing that the administration cannot practice the
                    neutrality it preaches. As divestment organizing continues
                    and universities across the U.S. search for examples of how
                    to respond, UChicago's action—or lack thereof—could set a
                    precedent for years to come.

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>
                    This project focused on pro-divestment activism and the
                    administration's response. Student- or faculty-led
                    counter-activism events were not included due to project
                    scope. A pro-divestment activism event was defined as
                    follows: 1. all articles from the Maroon website or
                    digitized archives which contained the word "divest" from
                    search results; 2. had divestment as the main subject,
                    excluding meta-commentary on effective strategies for
                    divestment activism or histories of divestment activism; 3.
                    defined divestment as withdrawing current investments, not
                    declining to renew contracts or other related topics; 4.
                    could be defined as a discrete instance, whether as a news
                    event or a publication, excluding duplicate coverage of the
                    same event; 5. were located on UChicago campus or involved
                    UChicago students, excluding reporting about other schools
                    or Chicago city politics.
