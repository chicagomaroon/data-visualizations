                        The debate over whether the University of Chicago
                        Medical Center (UCMC) should open an adult, Level I

                        and South Side health concerns. Many believe the UCMC
                        has forgone a moral obligation to open a trauma center.
                        However, some respond that UCMC lack the funds to
                        support such an endeavor, as it provides a substantial
                        amount of care to underinsured, south side residents.

                    <p class="text body-text first-paragraph">
                        THE MAROON asked Pritzker Associate Dean of Students,
                        Dr. Jim Woodruff, about the most pressing South Side
                        health concerns. Arriving to UCMC over 20 years ago, Dr.
                        Woodruff is a general medicine physician and has
                        practiced at the community health clinic branch in
                        Englewood.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Woodruff highlighted the importance of understanding
                        that trauma does pose a significant burden on the South
                        Side. “As a primary care doctor, I am confronted with
                        patients who have been victims of trauma and are often
                        disabled because of their encounters,” Woodruff said.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text body-text">
                        However, they may not be the biggest killers hospitals
                        like UCMC have to manage, despite overwhelming press
                        coverage. “In terms of the actual numbers of people
                        affected by these issues, the burden of chronic medical
                        disease far outweighs the issue of violent trauma here
                        on the South Side of Chicago…but I don’t understand why
                        pressing issues such as these chronic medical conditions
                        don’t receive as much attention in the press.”

                        Chronic issues such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension

                        coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease
                        requiring dialysis, were several diseases that Dr.
                        Woodruff believes do not garner enough attention.

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        “[These diseases] are associated with levels of
                        disability and other measures of health that in many of
                        the neighborhoods in the south side compare to
                        third-world nations, yet, these are issues that are not
                        talked about as frequently as they should be in the
                        press,” Woodruff said.

                        4th year Pritzker Medical Student, and President of
                        Medical Students for Health Equity (M-SHE), Abdullah
                        Pratt, corroborated Dr. Woodruff’s assessment. Pratt
                        spent much of his childhood in the Woodlawn area, and is
                        no stranger to the burden of violence, having witnessed
                        the death of his brother on the South Side. “If you were
                        to brand the South Side of Chicago, it would be
                        ‘gun-violence and crime,’” Pratt said. He believes that
                        UCMC should eventually open an adult level 1 Trauma
                        Center (T1), as the main hospitals which have perfected
                        trauma treatment are within the county system.

                    <p class="text body-text">
                        Yet, he states that chronic care is still the surpassing
                        medical priority. Because many of Chicago’s lower income
                        residents live in the South Side, conditions such as
                        diabetes, asthma and heart attack are, to Pratt, of
                        paramount medical importance. “I think the average
                        person would say trauma because of the news,” Pratt
                        said. “The dialysis center looks like a waiting line for
                        free food in a depression. But, you don’t see ’55 year
                        old man died from complications of kidney disease’ on
                        the news”.

                    However, she emphasized data isn’t the only way one should
                    justify the building of a trauma center. “We try not to have
                    a data driven campaign, because I feel like that reinforces
                    an ideology that we don’t believe in” Wachira said. “That
                    you can justify life by number…you can’t justify the value
                    of a trauma center by looking at a balance sheet.” The
                    availability of a trauma center is a way, she believes, UCMC
                    can more effectively address South Side youth mortality.

                    Veronica Morris Moore, youth organizer for Fearless Leading
                    By the Youth, was raised on the South Side and has witnessed
                    the burden of poverty, drugs and gang violence. She said
                    that violence provides a source of income and an avenue for
                    the most basic needs to many black youth. “We don’t make
                    that choice to grow up poor, to grow up around guns and
                    drugs. And, we don’t have a whole lot of ability to change
                    the circumstances,” she said. “If I take my little brother,
                    for example, it was the way he put food in his mouth when my
                    mom couldn’t. It was the way he put shoes on his feet.”

                <p class="text body-text">
                    She emphasized violent trauma’s disproportionate affect on
                    black youth deserves recognition. “It needs to be seen as a
                    health epidemic in relation to young black people” Moore
                    said. “Those of us who come from these neighborhoods need to
                    be taken into account…even more so over these numbers.” To
                    her, the push for a Trauma Center and the utilization of
                    direct action, are fueled by the collective feeling that the
                    lives of black youth have been neglected.

                    “It’s not the fact that [violence] is killing off hundreds
                    of people. It’s the people that it’s killing off, and that’s
                    why it’s not important [to UCMC]” Moore said. “Are our lives
                    not worth saving?”
