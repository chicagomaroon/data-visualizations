                    In the past two years, several high-profile events have
                    roiled campuses nationwide and caused increased scrutiny on
                    university endowments. In 2023, campus organizers pressed
                    for divestment from Israeli companies in response to the
                    genocide in Gaza. Starting with President Trump's
                    inauguration in January, once-reliable federal funding has
                    become uncertain, causing many to believe universities
                    should draw from their endowments to make up the loss. More
                    generally, since elite universities overhauled their
                    investment strategies starting around 1985, endowments have
                    ballooned to controversial levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It seems like everyone suddenly has an opinion about
                    endowments. But for the less Booth-inclined, this piece aims
                    to answer: what is an endowment, exactly? How does it work?
                    Who controls it? And why should we care? Answering these
                    questions is not easy for the University of Chicago, because
                    private universities have minimal reporting requirements and
                    are accountable mainly to their stakeholders rather than to
                    the public at large. Still, the beginnings of a picture can
                    be developed from what little information exists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Maroon's data desk compiled datasets from three publicly
                    available sources (XXX do we list what sources) to build the
                    fullest picture to date of the University's endowment, which
                    is one of the 20 largest private university endowments in
                    the United States.

                        University endowments are separate from student tuition.
                        That's because universities' income consists of many
                        sources with different restrictions. Tuition goes
                        towards day-to-day operating expenses without getting
                        invested; endowments, on the other hand, stem from
                        private donors and are managed by investors.

                    <p>
                        Universities withdraw a percentage from this endowment
                        to cover their remaining costs after tuition and other
                        revenue are accounted for, about 4-5% per year. The
                        remainder of the endowment is re-invested. In 2024, the
                        University withdrew 5% of its endowment to support
                        operating costs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of a university's endowment is typically
                        restricted, which means that donors have put rules
                        around what their donation can be used for. For example,
                        the Pearson family moved to withdraw their funds from
                        the Pearson Institute at UChicago due to alleged
                        contract breaches in 2018.

                <div class="scroller" id="restricted">
                    <p>
                        X% of UChicago's endowment consists of restricted funds.
                        Still, well-endowed universities don't have their hands
                        completely tied. "They should make clear that their
                        formidable financial endowments are not there to simply
                        be envied or admired," wrote Larry H. Summers earlier
                        this year. "Part of their function is to be drawn down
                        in the face of emergencies, and covering federal funding
                        lapses surely counts as one. Believe me, a former
                        president of Harvard, when I say that ways can be found
                        in an emergency to deploy even parts of the endowment
                        that have been earmarked by their donors for other
                        uses."

                <div class="scroller" id="what-is-it">
                    <p>
                        At UChicago, donations are funneled into a pot called
                        the Total Return Investment Pool, or TRIP. The TRIP is
                        in turn invested into various equities and assets. The
                        major distinction here is between public equities--what
                        most people think of as "stocks"--and private equities,
                        which involve individual donors, venture capitalists,
                        and hedge funds. Because stock exchanges are regulated
                        by the federal government, more data is available on
                        public equities compared to private equities.

                        UChicago is a private university. This means that while
                        it must comply with general financial reporting
                        requirements for nonprofits, it is not subject to the
                        more stringent requirements for public universities. It
                        has incentive to keep all this behind closed doors:
                        information about investment strategies would give
                        institutions a competitive edge over their peers. This
                        is one reason why universities have in the past refused
                        to comply with activists' demands for transparency,
                        although the University has on some occasions fulfilled
                        narrower requests. When the Associated Press asked 50
                        public and private universities to provide information
                        about their endowments, 39 schools refused and 4 did not
                        respond. Even Congress has failed to glean information
                        about endowments.

                        Still, even for a private university, UChicago is
                        exceptional: in 2023, Amnesty International rated the
                        University as the least transparent among 10 peer
                        institutions, with a score of 0 out of 40. The
                        University appears to have stopped publishing even its
                        Annual Report since 2022.

                        The Internal Revenue Service requires all nonprofits to
                        file the 990-T tax form.

                    <p>
                        Schedule L of the 990-T form requires universities to
                        list conflicts of interest. This often includes
                        investment firms with which the university invests its
                        endowment that are also owned by its trustees.

                        The University paid each of the following firms for
                        endowment management services in 2023. The available
                        data indicates that the University has worked with the
                        following firms for as long as 10 years.

                        For decades, campus groups wishing to influence the
                        University's finances have held protests targeting
                        either the Board of Trustees or the University
                        President, both to little success. To understand why
                        organizers target these two groups, it may help to take
                        a look at the flowchart below.

                    <p>
                        As this chart demonstrates, the Board of Trustees is
                        ultimately the final decisionmaker about investment
                        approaches. The Board of Trustees acts as a steering
                        committee for the Office of Investments, which is
                        responsible for overseeing the endowment and answers to
                        the President. The campus community has three avenues
                        for giving input to investment strategy: the Faculty
                        Senate, a board comprising 51 elected faculty; the
                        Graduate Council, with 6 executive members and elected
                        representatives from the 12 graduate divisions; and
                        Advisory Councils, which have 10-95 members across 14
                        committees composed of "friends and alumni" of the
                        University. None of these bodies currently have regular
                        meetings with the Board of Trustees, although the
                        Graduate Council held a quarterly "Student Perspectives
                        Series" with the Board from 2016-2021.

                        The Office of Investments hires and communicates with
                        external asset management firms. "Often, even the
                        institutions themselves don’t know where their money
                        goes, in part because they hire outside managers who
                        constantly buy and sell investments. Additionally, many
                        schools put their money into mutual or hedge funds,
                        which in turn make other investments that can be kept
                        confidential," reported the Associated Press in 2016.

                    <p>
                        But ignorance is a choice, not a rule. According to
                        Brenden O'Connell, an employee of a hedge-fund firm that
                        manages university endowments, any institution with a
                        separately managed account (SMA) can request
                        restrictions on their investments. "An SMA would be
                        customized for you, usually. So you can impose
                        constraints, [such as] you don't want exposure to XYZ
                        industries, and then the manager will tailor the
                        portfolio accordingly". For example, UChicago could
                        easily request that its endowment is not invested in
                        fossil-fuel companies. Harvard did exactly this in 2021.

                        Similarly, former Trustee Tom Cole appeared to deflect
                        responsibility for decisions regarding investments.
                        Notes from a 2016 meeting summarized his remarks: "It
                        would be unusual for a discussion of a potential Kalven
                        exception to emerge from within the Board itself.
                        Rather, it is the role of the president and the officers
                        to transmit issues of concern to the trustees and that
                        discussions subsequently occur at the Executive
                        Committee level and then might come before the entire
                        Board."

                    <p>
                        Yet according to the official governing documents of the
                        University of Chicago, as of May 2024, the President is
                        actually "responsible, under the supervision of the
                        Board, for the management of…investments, investment
                        properties, and special property holdings in the
                        neighborhood of the University" (emphasis added for
                        clarity). In a 2015 interview, then-President Zimmer
                        conceded: "Investments are the responsibility of the
                        Board of Trustees…this is a Board matter, but if I had
                        to report on my sense of the Board’s view of this—is
                        that they’re unlikely to want to do that."

                    Many members of campus have given statements on why they
                    think greater transparency is needed. Below is a summary of
                    some of their arguments.
                </p>
                <h3>The argument for fiscal responsibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Even before the funding cuts, Professor Clifford Ando has
                    dedicated ten op-eds in the Maroon to criticizing what he
                    sees as the University's irresponsible management of funds,
                    including growing debt and a disproportionately increasing
                    presidential salary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He calls for greater transparency and communication: "The
                    University of Chicago’s pathology for secrecy regarding the
                    simple facts of its own operations does not suggest
                    confidence on the part of its leadership, despite their
                    power. They should announce their vision proudly and provide
                    the data for it to be analyzed and discussed."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The push for transparency is not limited to UChicago.
                    Professors at UC CITE and students at the University of
                    Michigan have also mounted campaigns to achieve
                    accountability for school finances. QUOTE FROM THESE

                <h3>The argument for moral responsibility</h3>
                <p>
                    When it comes to investment, one important distinction is
                    between the primary and secondary market. When a company
                    goes public, it signals to the public that it needs to raise
                    money amounting to its initial public offering (IPO). This
                    is called the primary market, which typically happens only
                    once to kickstart a burgeoning company. What most people
                    think of as the stock market is actually the secondary
                    market, where players on the stock market buy and trade
                    stocks with each other. The key here is that the original
                    company does not obtain direct monetary benefit from the
                    secondary market. Therefore, "investing in" a company does
                    not financially benefit that company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still, pro-divestment activists argue that investing in a
                    company sends a message to the rest of the world, saying
                    that the company's products are valuable. Withdrawing
                    investments in a company, in turn, can pressure it to change
                    its practices.
                </p>
                <h3>The argument for social responsibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Most financial experts do agree that excluding any sector
                    from a portfolio is not the most profitable strategy. Just
                    like diversity in ecosystems or human societies is better
                    for everyone, diversity in investment portfolios produces
                    maximal return. Another way of putting it is the age-old
                    saying: don't put all your eggs in one basket. Yet, again,
                    fears about divestment may be overblown. XXX FIRM QUOTE THE
                    REPORT estimated that divesting from fossil fuels would only
                    reduce margins by X%.

                    Actually, O'Connell points out that the mere idea of
                    "maximal return" is controversial even in the financial
                    community. "So overall, let's say they they have a billion
                    dollars, and then they generate $100 million profit, then
                    they take $50 million and use that for spending to cover all
                    sorts of operations, and then they have maybe $10 or $30
                    million of that to cover inflation, but then you still have,
                    then you still have 30 left over. And some people will say
                    that is unnecessary, because the endowment will keep that 30
                    and they'll reinvest it back into the portfolio, and it'll
                    compound over decades…Some people will say that 30 million
                    you didn't need, now you're just compounding the principal
                    and the endowment's getting bigger and bigger." The way he
                    describes this pattern brings to mind an ego contest between
                    elite universities.

                    As endowments grow continually, some are questioning whether
                    their original purpose as safety nets is still being
                    honored.

                    <blockquote>
                        When these endowments are like, 'No, we're not going to
                        step in here', then people are like, 'What's the point
                        of the endowment?' Isn't this the exact scenario where
                        the endowment should step in?

                    Today's enormous endowments stem from the so-called Yale
                    investment strategy, popularized by David Swensen in 1985.
                    In a departure from the strategies of the time, Swensen
                    posited that riskier investments--in private equity and
                    international stocks--would yield higher returns. This
                    change in strategy is reflected in the data about UChicago,
                    which has invested increasingly in private equity over the
                    last 20 years.
